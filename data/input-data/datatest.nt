<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730001> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This development project aims to reduce engine emissions using Aeristech's patented electric motor-driven compressor and turbine-driven electric generator (\"Hybrid Turbocharger Technology\", HTT). A feasibility study has shown that HTT can improve engine efficiency and reduce emissions. A previous GRD industrial research project showed that HTT components could be designed and built to the required specifications for engine turbocharging. This project will integrate HIT with an engine in order to achieve increased power and reduced emissions, in-line with theoretical expectations. First, Aeristech will develop an off-road heavy diesel variant, since these engines are simple and cost-effective to modify and tune. Second, Aeristech will develop a mainstream automotive engine demonstrator with a more complex control system and a more refined mechanical design. Following the project, Aeristech will develop HIT into a product portfolio targeting a wide variety of engines across heavy diesel and automotive markets." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730002> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Aims - To develop a machine that will significantly increase the hand pickinQ\\ output of Raspberries grown in polytunnels. The availability of picking labour is becoming the biggest problem facing growers. If the issue is not resolved crops will increasingly remain unharvested and will rot in the fields. A successful project will result in a machine with a small crew that will reduce the harvesting labour by a targeted 40%. Deliverables - pre-production prototype drawing and specification for production procedures for operation Test report following field trials Reasons for the work - The Raspberry is a very delicate fruit that is easily damaged by wind, rain, excess heat, mishandling and inappropriate storage. Growing the fruit in polytunnels reduces the risk of damage from the weather and will help to sustain the industry in changing climatic conditions. The delicate nature of the fruit means that it must be hand picked, but finding picking labour is becoming the growers' biggest problem. If the industry is to survive it must find a solution to the labour problem. The aims of the project are to reduce the picking labour for Raspberries grown in polytunnels by 40% and to reduce imports, which in recent years have impacted UK homegrown sales, so reducing food miles." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730003> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "'VISION' will require a new architectural approach and to meet market demand it must provide significant technical and commercial benefits. This new architecture will be based upon a Services Platform through which all of the inventory management applications will be linked i.e. the Services Platform will act as a 3PL Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). The planned benefits for the new architecture will be to: • Enable Proteus to make its products available as a set of integrated services that can be sold on a per usage basis as opposed to fixed licenses. This will allow 3Pls to tailor costs to their direct needs while enabling Proteus to control their deployment costs; • Reduce maintenance costs for Proteus and its clients while improving the level of service for maintenance. Release as a Cloud based service means that support is focused on the hosted versions only. Once the hosted service has been upgraded then all instances will be automatically updated. This reduces the time and cost of maintenance and allows for regular updates for continually improving the service; • Enable Proteus to respond more rapidly to the functional and service needs of their clients by deploying new services based upon novel combinations of established and new services for inventory management systems. New products based upon different combinations of the base can be created and deployed rapidly. A 'sell-up' migration path can also be created therefore a 3PL can provide better and more services to its clients; • Simplify the difficulties of integrating the Proteus range of services with approved third party service suppliers. The service interfaces and application programming interfaces will be released to approved third party developers so that other products can be integrated to the Proteus product set. This will promote the use of the Proteus products as core inventory management systems and will help other vendors provide integrated solutions." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730004> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The aim of this project to produce a fully automated electronic alarm that informs beekeepers that a hive of bees has began making preparations to swarm. The project should result in a function prototype. Without a swarm alarm, bee keepers need to perform regular and intensive hive inspections. Not only do these inspections require a lot of time, they are not always performed as regularly and/or intensively as they need to be, as a consequence they are not always effective. Swarming bees are not only a nuisance to the public, due to the cost of replacement bees and the resulting loss of honey crop, swarms are also expensive for the beekeeper. In addition, due to a pest called Varoa, a lost swarm of bees will struggle to survive in the wild and can no longer contribute to the country's pollinating force. Not only will this device help existing beekeepers minimise swarming, it should also encourage people to take it up as it drastically simplifies the beekeeping process. Furthermore, once the device is widespread there is the potential to provide scientists researching the drastic decline of the honey bee with large amounts of valuable data. There are currently an estimated 275 thousand bee hives in the UK alone and the cost of replacement bees lost in a swarm is £50. There are 2.4 million bee hives in the USA and a further 9 million in Europe alone. No swarm alarm currently exists; this product would be completely unique and would have no competitors in the market. Identification and successful interpretation of swarm indicators possible to measure by electronic means represents a significant technological advance in itself. This project would be a very good example of British innovation. The total cost of the project is approximately £140,000, the majority of this will be internal as the project team members are expert and will be devoted to this project full time. Due to time constraints, the majority of external consultancy work will be sought from a local University. The approximate time scale for this project is 18 months. The important milestones are: identifying the physical swarm indicators, developing hardware (a circuit board) to measure these indicators, developing firmware (a computer program) to intemperate these indicators, producing a working prototype and testing the prototype. The project will be based in the north east of England. All staff will be employed in the north east of England. External consultants will be employed from the north east of England. All equipment will be sourced from the north east of England. Although experimental work will be conducted in the north east of England, the majority of will be conducted in Italy as the climate and native breed of honey bee better reflects the mass market at which this device is aimed." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730005> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "BioToolomics Ltd is a life science company offering cutting-edge solutions to the cost-effective purification of biopharmaceutical drugs. The project is tilted \"Negative chromatography technology for the cost-effective manufacturing of antibody biopharmaceuticals\". In simple term, according to this technology, an antibody drug produced in cell culture broth is purified by total removal of its surrounding impurities with our selective but inexpensive chromatography media. In contrast, conventional purification technology directly captures antibody drugs with expensive and capacity-limited Protein-A affinity media. With the strong support of two previous Research Grants, BioToolomics has successfully identified the know-hows in making inexpensive process chromatography base matrix, disposable columns and selective mixed-mode ligands. BioToolomics has built up a large library of mixed-mode chromatography media. By coupling the selective mixed-mode ligands to the inexpensive base matrix, very innovative process chromatography products in a ready-to-use disposable format could be developed and deployed in totally new and cost-saving antibody manufacturing processes. Novartis (one of the top five pharmaceutical giants) has agreed to collaborate with BioToolomics to evaluate the technology. We expect to form more collaborations with other big pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, it is the logical decision for BioToolomics to develop the technology towards the market-ready status to harvest its great commercial potential." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730006> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The Project is to research the feasibility of making a new networking module that will be able to operate independent of mains power. This means that in some environments a (rechargeable) battery replaced on annual maintenance schedule would be appropriate and in others an energy 'harvesting' solution such as solar PV would be used. '-- I' One additional feature that would enhance the market attractiveness of a new product is developing a module which can work \"out of the box\". The current products on the market require design and software development input from a development engineer. A 'plug-and-play' solution would make such a unit an easy choice for initial prototyping work when developers are looking to add wireless connectivity to new devices. Getting in to new developments at the prototyping stage is key to becoming the module of choice when new products are scaled up for market launch. Clusterstack is very clear about the specification for an attractive highly adoptable wireless connectivity module. It must be a plug-and-play module allowing designers to use it very quickly with the minimum of effort; it must be ultra-low-power running on rechargeable batteries or solar; it needs to offer a predictable network latency allowing designers to know absolutely when a given message will arrive at its destination so that the system can be used for industrial control, as well as monitoring and reporting; it must be scalable and not overload with high node count; and, be based on the low-cost 15.4 standard platform." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730007> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Platform for semantic web and system engineering applications" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730007> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The Semantic Web is the next major development for the World Wide Web (WWW). Currently we can only publish unstructured data on web pages, which cannot be processed by computer applications. The Semantic Web will enable the publication of structured data, effectively turning the WWW into one global database. While this has been shown to work in principle by researchers such as those at Southampton University, it suffers from the same problems referred to in Slide 3. Here the portal is replaced by the lnternet/intranet, and the data warehouse replaced by what is called \"Triple Store\" (a structured database accessible over the Internet), Slide 6. Slide 7 depict the architectures for the current technology and Slide 8 how the uiP solve this problem. Furthermore, all current research in the area is focused on information modelling only. No effort is being spent today on how data published on the Semantic Web may be used - other than to read the data, which is not much improvement on what can be done with web pages. A possible reason for this is that while the Semantic Web information model is simple, elegant and extensible, it is not suited for implementation in software applications. Software applications run more effectively on data structured in tabular form (i.e. the relational database model). Modelling techniques and methodologies used in the Semantic Web area can also be applied to supporting the System Engineering Methodology (ISO 15288). ISO 15288 is a more comprehensive standard than the well-know ISO 9001. While many large multinational corporations have been adopting System Engineering Methodologies in some form, none of these have been computer based. The requirements for Syystem Engineering are similar to those for the Semantic Web. So if the Semantic Web issues can be solved, the same solution would equally apply to supporting System Engineering Methodologies. Effective System Engineering Methodologies are essential in major programmes where not only data and system integration issues need to be solved, but also how to model and manage processes, activities people and deliverables and objectives, all of which can change through the execution of a major programme. Slide 9 shows a relatively small problem can escalate to be a major problem that can threaten the very existence of a company. In the case of the Airbus A380 super jumbo programme, a wiring harness design problem that was not addressed in time, resulted in 5bn euro being wiped of the value of Airbus parent company, EADS, in one week. The Challenger space shuttle disaster that lost the lives of 7 US astronauts was the result of contractors systems using different units of measure that was not spotted in time. This project aims to demonstrate how these problems may be solved." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730008> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "EV (Medical Screening) Ltd ('EV') was established in 2008 to commercialise the invention of a low cost, high performance, portable EV Gas Analyser™ using plasma emission spectroscopy ('PES'). PES involves the spectral analysis of light generated from a gaseous sample through which a small (c. 5mm) electric arc is passed between two small metal electrodes. The technique has already been demonstrated by others to be highly sensitive for the detection of trace quantities of inorganic ions in water. EV is now applying patented and proprietary PES techniques to important opportunities provided by the detection of trace Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in air- particularly in human breath -for use in non-invasive medical diagnostics. 16 The first commercial application of the technology will be the quantitative analysis o. acetone in human breath for the quick, totally non-invasive, highly accurate, and costeffective screening, diagnosis and monitoring, of both 'Type 1' and 'Type 2' diabetes. Future medical applications include the early non-invasive detection of lung cancer, asthma and other diseases." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730009> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Development of a skin explant assay as a unique tool for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730009> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Alcyomics Ltd was founded to develop and commercialise novel and highly marketable solutions for pre-clinical drug testing for inflammatory immune responses and cellular therapies. Alcyomics' expertise is based around the unique human Skin Explant Assay (SEA) which can be used as a diagnostic tool, to test drugs and compounds for potential allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, including individual responses to stem cells and cellular therapies. This unique platform is already generating revenues, and is poised for growth. Animal testing is unpopular with the public and provides only a partial guide to drug responses in man. Drug companies are becoming increasingly reliant upon human tissue- based assays to improve drug development and bring drugs closer to market in a shorter period of time, ultimately reducing drug R&D costs. Drugs that prove safe in preclinical animal testing often end up failing when they are first tested in humans, wasting precious time and research funds It is now estimated that the average cost of bringing a new drug to market is $1 bn (€ 0.8bn) and is increasing at a rate of nearly 50 per cent every five to seven years. Analysts believe that a 10% increase in the speed of drug development can save $100m for every new drug. The problem is compounded by the lack of effective in vitro models and the continued reliance on animal testing. Ethical issues aside, the problem with current animal testing is that it is always still one step away from answering the important question \"what will my drug do in man?\" This is one of the reasons that 90% of compounds that drug-makers take into human clinical trials ultimately fail to become viable medicines. The Skin Explant Assay (SEA) offers a unique tool for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, minimising risk in drug research and reducing animal testing. This non-artificial, human in vitro assay technology allows the study of primary immune and secondary immune cellular responses in the presence of immunomodulatory drugs i.e. drugs that effect the immune system, such as transplant rejection and autoimmune disease drugs. The assay can also be used to study allogeneic (between 2 individuals) stem cell transplantation, without the need for extensive animal testing. In the assay white blood cells, lymphocytes, which are cells of the immune system, are incubated with human skin which allows skin damage to be assessed by histopathology. The skin is graded for histological damage using criteria similar to that used and observed in the clinical setting. The results correlate with systemic disease and have been shown to predict outcome. Alcyomics believe that the SEA will benefit the pre-clinical stage of the drug discovery process; in particular, safety, efficacy and dose studies. Alcyomics is at present a service provider to SMEs and academic institutions for the preclinical testing of novel immuno-suppressant drugs. This initial customer base provides confidence that the technology is meeting a need in the huge market for development of biological and cellular therapeutics. Alcyomics needs to develop the assay for faster throughput and results' read-out in order to attract large pharmaceutical companies as clients. We also need to continuously evolve the current assay and research innovative new technology for IP protection." .

The key feature of combinatorial chemistry is that compound synthesis is designed such that a range of analogues can be produced using similar reaction conditions, either in the same reaction vessel, or individually in parallel using semi-automated synthesis. In this way, the bench-chemist can single-handedly prepare many hundreds or thousands of compounds in the time usually taken to prepare only a few by orthodox methodology. Combinatorial chemistry is thus a major tool in the drug discovery process. Effective application of this technology requires the availability of a wide range of chemical building blocks with diverse structures." .

The commercial product design must consider the way the product will be manufactured so suitable production techniques must be evaluated and a commercial ready product designed accordingly. Throughout the product development, an expensive and sophisticated BWC systems design would be unacceptable to the aims of this project. Task 1 will seek to address the commercial product design issues, i.e. attention to design optimisation and cost reduction, process and methodology of manufacture to be explored in detail aim for minimum step manufacture. The formalisation of a detailed operational requirement specification for the 200kg BWC systems design needs to take account of both the technical and market requirements for the final product. The operating requirement specification will be used to determine an end user functional design specification document. The design specification document must consider the way the product will be manufactured and suitable production techniques must be identified leading to design solutions that are commercial viable." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730013> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Thermacore are world leaders in the design, development and manufacture of thermal systems, particularly utilising their core competence of heat pipes and integrating them into solutions for a wide variety of customers and industries. See Fig 1. Conventional heat pipes are manufactured using a variety of container materials, including copper, carbon steels, stainless steels, aluminium and in some cases titanium. The container creates a hermetically sealed chamber to allow a vacuum to be drawn within the container or heat pipe and allow it to function at low temperatures. Heat Pipes require a wick to /itf:ucture to function. The wick enables the working fluid contained within the Heat Pipe to be transported from the condenser to the evaporator end. Capillary forces within the wick assist the movement of the liquid. Internal wick structures are required that are compatible with the container material. Therefore one of the main aims of this project is to identify container and wick materials that are compatible with each other and also with any chosen working fluid There is constant pressure from end users to further improve the overall performance of heat pipes. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, thermal performance, costs and weight. Heat pipes, particularly those made from aluminium, are used extensively in the aerospace industry, however their thermal performance can be up to 50% lower than that of an equivalent copper-based heat pipe, whilst costs in some cases are higher than copper-based heat pipes." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730014> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The project aims to improve yield in a high technology multilayer Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing operation. Specifically we will target a major area of PCB yield loss - \"registration\": that is the ability in the manufacturing process to ensure that the multiple layers in the PCB align accurately and predictably to each other. As the technology requirement of PCBs increases to cope with high product technology and materials become thinn,er and more unstable, it becomes progressively more difficult to align these multiple layers. The PCB manufacturing process is, by necessity, a multi-step operation involving mechanical and/or chemical processing. Each process step involves one or more machines- each with a specific role to play for that process step. The majority of such machines are designed and built by specialised companies focussed on their \"area of expertise\" and there is no single machine manufacturer who can supply systems for the complete manufacture of PCBs. Each process step in the manufacture of PCBs is therefore handled in isolation and although data related to the PCB at that step is available, it is generally used solely at - and for - that process and because the data comes from multiple machine systems, there is no standardised data format for communication. XACT's business is focussed on solving PCB registration. Our systems have been adopted by the leading PCB manufacturers globally. Our product range (GeminiX) uses a link between the CAM system and just one of the PCB manufacturing process islands: the x-ray optimiser 1 . On a timeline of PCB manufacture for a standard product one could place this process at about 60% of the total manufacturing time. By collecting data from that process we are able to gain a picture of the registration status at that process step. This allows us to build a predictive model of the total material distortion that is present at that point in the process. We then compensate the electronic data at CAM for a production batch to minimise the effect of distortion that will occur to that point in the process. Our system is a feedback based system. The above data collection point was chosen because the overriding total distortion is visible at that process, however, it is the case that we are only measuring the \"sum of all previous process distortions\" and cannot isolate specific upstream process effects. Moreover, we are unable to monitor or influence any process influence that is \"downstream\" of the current measurement point." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730015> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This project aims to build upon the work carried out over the last 18months at Crystal Scientific. We already have a pre-production prototype 1.2m flat X-ray mirror enhanced by differential coating. The fabrication of this mirror has involved using the latest metrology equipment at the Diamond Light Source, Oxford, and the collaboration of metrology scientists at this institution. This new method for enhancing the performance of x-ray mirrors has huge promise and the data from our 1.2m flat mirror is to be presented at a scientific meeting and published in its corresponding journal. The aim of this development project is to prove the consistency and reliability of the differential coating technique and to fully incorporate this technique into our production process. We aim to manufacture a series of flat x-ray mirrors of different sizes ranging from 400mm to 1.5m in length. We will apply differential coatings to these mirrors to test the reliability and reproducibility of this technique. This work will culminate in the production of a number of demonstration prototype mirrors to be sent to metrology laboratories world-wide for evaluation. We also aim to extend the differential coating technique to the manufacture of elliptical mirrors. The significant innovation and technical advance of this project will be to develop state of the art mirrors with minimal residual slope errors which can compete directly with the established (bi-morph) mirror technology and be of direct benefit to the scientific community." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730016> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The main types of LED used in today's products are surface mount and through hole. Through Hole LEOs are very inefficient, usually only allowing a few 10s of milliamps to be passed through them before overheating and failing. Surprisingly however, even today, many lamp manufacturers still use vast quantities of these LEOs in series and parallel circuits to act together to form an overall illuminator. Although cheap they are generally inefficient, short lived, corrode internally, of poor output capabilities and due to EU compliance legislation are difficult to dispose of. In addition they are incredibly inefficient at dissipating heat from the body of the device as to use them requires a through-hole PCB in the traditional sense. When used in assemblies these are typically accompanied by very large elaborate heat sinks machined or extruded from aluminium. The main drawback of this is that the whole assembly is too expensive to repair should it fail and in addition can only produce one colour of light. Despite all of these failings however the industry relies on vast quantities of these illuminators today, as throw away lights of 2 - 5 year life span costing from a few to several hundreds of pounds each, this inefficient practice in reality counters the \"green\" argument for their original use. Surface Mount, although a great leap forward both in terms of efficiency and output these packages still suffer from the same issues of its through hole predecessor. They still come in a package, require soldering, suffer from poor heat dissipation (although are an improvement) corrode and are, conversely, very expensive sometimes to several pounds each. However, the use of surface mount packages has brought about aluminium-clad assemblies, a revolution in PCB technology, which has only recenUy hit the commercial stage. Despite this, some of the old failings still remain and in some cases have worsened. For example, the assembly of the aluminium clad requires specialist processes and tooling to raise the temperature of the entire board to around 320 degrees before components can be soldered to them. The components are still soldered, which again causes yet another junction through which heat must be dissipated and due to this they are even less serviceable than the through hole units. Although the boards are, new they still use the same heavy aluminium heat sinks and techniques and sold as a throw away item. However, where output illumination is the principle consideration the use of surface mount packages is where the current in-direct competition resides, with only very small increases in power output being realised in each individual case between competitor manufacturers." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730017> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The project will create entirely automated, scalable and novel on demand drug design and synthesis services to support early drug discovery by SME's and academic groups operating as \"Micro-Pharmas\", allowing them to be competitive with large pharmaceutical companies. It will create a repository of chemicals which can be rapidly synthesised on demand, supplemented by pre-existing and commercially available samples and conventional chemistry synthesis when necessary. Customers will search the repository by sophisticated on-line molecular design algorithms. Physical samples will be produced \"on demand\" by novel micro-reactor synthetic methods or acquired from commercial compound suppliers, and the samples prepared and shipped to the customer ready for testing using highly accurate automated dispensing equipment. The project involves the integration of micro-reactor chemical synthesis methods with advanced computer-based drug design systems. Chemicals will be synthesised in chip micro-reactors using pre-defined reagents and synthetic routes which will require the development of predictive systems capable of accurately estimating the products of the reagents/route combinations available. The project will combine the predictive systems for micro-reactor chemistry with prediction of the properties required for success as a drug, including biological activity, bioavailability, physical and toxicological properties. If the project is successful, Molplex will offer chemicals that have been designed to have the biological, physical, bioavailability and toxicity properties necessary to be a successful drug and synthesise them \"on demand\". By combining property prediction, the optimal combination of reagents/synthetic routes will be developed to focus on developing chemistry with high value potential in all therapeutic areas. The project will transform the current basic chemical search offering to create new and globally accessible drug discovery services \"on demand\". Chemicals will be delivered in pre-packaged, assay-ready form for use in drug discovery screening in customer assays or, if required, sent directly to specialist screening companies. The customer would only pay for what they are interested in, when they require them, eliminating the need to purchase expensive chemical storage facilities, stock and chemical synthesis, and the costs of setting up the associated specialist equipment and expertise. This service would remove the very high cost barriers to entry for new drug discovery by replacing the high capital investment (typically £3-4 M) needed to establish chemical storage, synthesis and screening as well as fixed costs for operations (typically £0.5M p.a.) with a dynamic and rapidly accessible pay-as-you-go service. This would open a new global market for drug discovery services aimed at small businesses, academic groups and research institutes across the world in which Molplex will have a unique, first-mover commercial advantage. Because of the high levels of automation of drug design, and synthesis that would be created by this project, Molplex could offer a uniquely scalable, global and flexible drug discovery service. In addition, the on-line systems will create a high profile showcase, leading to a customised-solutions business, targeted at the conventional mini and mega-Pharma market sectors." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730018> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The CODE-PM project represents a new approach to drug development. The aim of CODE-PM is to generate high-value Intellectual Property (IP) in the emerging field of pharmaceutical cocrystals for subsequent out-licensing to the pharmaceutical industry. A cocrystal is a crystalline entity in which more than one molecular substance is incorporated into the repeating unit cell (see Annex 1: Scientific Appendix). A pharmaceutical cocrystal therefore is comprised of a drug compound and one or more other compounds, referred to as coformers. CODE-PM is an extension of the development activities of Nuformix Ltd - a virtual drug development company based at The Wilton Centre, formed in October 2008. CODE-PM will help address an immediate market opportunity arising from the convergence of advances in the sciences of crystal engineering, continuous processing and nanoparticulates, combined with a buoyant pharmaceutical in-licensing market. i) Why is there a need? Drug cocrystals often have very different physical properties from their pure form and these important changes offer great commercial and societal potential. Varying the coformer provides a new opportunity to optimise or improve a drug's performance in any number of aspects, including: • Bioavailability and product efficacy • Cost of manufacture • Ease of formulation and manufacture • Chemical stability • Product shelf life and ease of storage • Patient benefits such as a reduction in side effects and removal of food effects It is estimated that as many as 70% of the world's top 500 drugs perform sub-optimally in any number of the above key performance areas. Delivering such improvements to existing drug products will substantially benefit both patients and drug manufacturers alike. Ultimately the products developed in the CODE-PM project will deliver cheaper medicines and more effective treatment of disease whilst enabling the pharmaceutical industry to sustain important new product development activities." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730019> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Nowadays almost all valves in the potable water industry are operated manually. A goal of the Project is a further development of a new reliable self-actuated valve with low energy consumption that can be controlled by the existing mobile phone communication networks and powered by energy that is harvested at the place of its installation. The truly remote control capability of the suggested valve will eliminate the necessity of construction of very expensive power and control lines (usually placed underground) which are required for the operation of conventional actuated valves. Wide application of the valves in pipe networks will have a dramatic environmental impact: the valve can be opened or closed immediately when necessary from a control office/station minimising spillages and provide the quickest and optimal way of supply re-routing in the network. It also will have a significant carbon footprint reduction in the network's operation because it is not necessary to send an operator- usually by vehicle- to the places where the valves are located. The strategic goal of the \"Intelligent Valve\" development aims at opening an extra dimension in pipe network management - to link control valves to an extended data network, coordinating control valve operation with the increasingly detailed data available on flow rates, pressures and other operating conditions. Connecting valves to a network allows distribution control, which can enable operators to reconfigure piping and networking systems so that a field can continue producing even if there is a blockage in, or damage to, the pipeline network." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730020> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This project is for the development of a new, innovative modular marking control system. These systems are used to mark components with unique identification codes and other manufacturing process information within industrial applications. This new systel1lttfiW provide control of laser, dot peen and scribe marking devices through the use of a1single integrated controller. Embedded software will replace the traditional PC-based controller implementation' A novel vision system will be used for quality control of the mark and as part of a manufacturing sequence. A new closed loop marking device realignment system will be introduced for end of line marking verification to ensure the mark remains within quality constraints. The development of IMCS is to address the global requirement to improve traceability. This is the case in every market sector with particular emphasis for Pryor within aerospace, automotive, defence, logistics, medical pharmaceutical and the oil and gas industry. Looking at the market from this point of view, the future of this sector will be with companies who are able to offer 'Traceability' solutions and currently manufacturers in this sector address one particular area of marking and produce 'stand alone' machines. Pryor has considered combining marking methodologies in the past but now feel that the market is right for an integrated solution to exploit lower production costs through alternative and innovative technology." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730021> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Furniss & White is a well-established foundry and supplier of value-adding services (e.g. casting upgrading, machining) with a reputation for product and process innovation. Potential clients have approached the Company to make sophisticated precision castings for demanding applications where there are major gains to be made in pump performance, if the key castings can be improved in terms of dimensional accuracy, surface finish and lead-times. Previously the Company has declined, based on recognised limitations in existing casting and mould-making processes; even those which represent 'state-of-the-art'. However, the Company had devised a highly innovative solution that combines and develops these 'technology platforms'. Whilst no single solution would meet the requirements of all the potential clients, this strategy is designed to shift the casting 'performance envelope' and allow clients to choose a new 'balance' of properties, costs and lead times. The project involves substantial technical challenges, as some of the technology platforms are barely out of the laboratory themselves, and will require substantial technical support from their developers. Further, each was developed in isolation, with no concept of being used (or combined) in the proposed fashion. Finally, there is only a benefit to the end clients (and hence the Company) if a new balance of all the properties is achieved consistently and efficiently. (see appendices for images of impellers)" .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730023> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Anti - Vibration Toolholders" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730023> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Vibration in metal cutting is familiar to every machine tool operator. This phenomenon is recognized in operations like internal turning, threading, grooving, milling, boring and drilling. There are several reasons why vibration problems occur. They are often related to the machine tool itself, the clamping of the tool, the length and diameter of the tool holder, and the cutting data to be used. Whilst anti-vibration bars are available, there is no unique fixing method for all types of machine tool, and users currently have to develop ad-hoc fixing methods due to the very varied types of machine. The objective of this project is to design and develop a standard range of toolholders to enable the maximum benefit of anti-vibration bars to be achieved. This standard range will be developed for each of the major machine tool manufacturers. Deliverables will be prototypes for a range of applications. A Norwegian company, Teeness, has developed and patented Anti Vibration Boring Bars. However, the company does not have an in-depth knowledge of tool holding, or the design information required to design toolholders for the major machine tool manufacturers. Currently, Teeness recommends the preferred clamping method to their customers, and relies on the customer to work with the machine tool supplier to provide a solution. Craftsman Tools has an in-depth knowledge in this field and is confident that it can develop a range of toolholders for all the major machine tool manufacturers. These toolholders will have interchangeable parts which will be suitable for different makes of machine tools, and ensure that anti vibration bars can be fitted to all machines, irrespective of manufacturer. The development of a standard range of anti-vibration toolholders, whilst particularly technically difficult to achieve, is an innovative progression for the industry in terms of radically improving the accuracy and rigidity of machine tools. The task is large and complex, but achievable, and a big step forward for the industry. From a company perspective, Craftsman Tools has an enviable reputation in the industry, and whilst margins are tight, and competition aggressive, the project is extremely necessary for the Company to maintain its market position with market led innovation." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730024> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Kirkstall is developing in-vitro cell culture systems. It recently completed a GRD Research project which established the technical and commercial feasibility of using technology licensed from the University of Pisa, to detect chemical toxicity. The GRD project also enabled the company to transfer the technology from Pisa into its laboratories in Sheffield, and to incorporate it into its first product, the Quasi-Vivo™ cell culture kit. This GRD Development project will aim to demonstrate the functionality of Kirkstall's existing Quasi-vivo™ system in new applications and add new features to the product to create a second generation prototype. Both these developments will help Kirkstall to better match the needs and demands from an emerging market for animal-free testing of product safety and efficacy. Although the Quasi-Vivo™ system is already being used by the academic research community and for contract research, the product needs further development to meet the needs of the chemical, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industry. Potential customers are looking for further evidence that the Quasi-Vivo™ system is more effective than existing methods. This project will aim to produce such evidence by investigating the correlation between existing in-vivo clinical data on 12 pharmaceutical and chemical com~ounds and the results from testing the toxicity of these same compounds in the Quasi-VivoT system. In addition it will add new features to the cell culture chambers to facilitate the optical observation of large cell colonies with 30 structure. This will be an important tool to aid the development of more representative tissue models for the study of chemical safety and toxicity." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730027> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "To date, we have an extensive range of energy hungry medium pressure lamp based products but only one single 200watt energy efficient Amalgam lamp model enclosed in a stainless steel chamber that has a very basic mechanical and electrical design. Others use multiple 300watt lamps immersed in support racks in open channels that move effluent in a canal like structure. The aim of this project is to shape the results of previous research (including our patent rights from CRAFT project) into a design for a new 800watt multi lamp Amalgam product involving significant technological advances in terms of lamp, hydraulic flow and control system aspects. In the project we would carry out development work including CFD modelling various combinations of UV light geometry, understand the necessary relevant international product approvals, source and test multiple lamp 800 watt power supplies, develop chamber designs that are mechanically robustly designed using stress predicffon software (that we currently do not have), develop a new touch screen controller to display and control multipl0 lamps (the current display is only 2 lines), and develop a control algorithm that will optimise applied lamp power using real time inputs such as flow, fluid transmittance and lamp intensity, with the overall objective of delivering the required UV dose with the lowest possible connected power. Our target would be to design a new product that uses 60% less power than our current technology. The overall deliverable of the project would be to develop and produce a pre-production prototype that would form the basis of a new product range to serve the rapidly expanding market to disinfect reclaimed effluent for a variety of uses, at a fraction of the power currently needed, thus materially effecting the carbon footprint of this technology." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730028> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The development of thoughtful nutrition and additional health benefits into Free From products forms the key part of our project. The basic process in itself is technically demanding and challenging. As well as avoiding staple baking ingredients such as flour( and any gluten containing cereals), we are also avoiding milk in its many forms -liquid, milk powder, whey, butter etc- which can be present in everything from dried fruit (as an anti caking agent) to baking powder and as such tends to be the second most common functional bakery ingredient behind flour. The Codex standards which define the amount of gluten permitted in products described as \"gluten free\" are about to be tightened. This may eliminate \"fringe producers\" and there is a further opportunity to improve our position by taking the market on to the next stage. As the market has developed, it now has a voice and it is clear that most special diet products tend to be higher in sugar and fats than their conventional counterparts and strong evidence to suggest that they are lower in fibre and protein too - salt content is an issue too. There is increasing focus within the food industry on these issues of thoughtful nutrition to counter health issues such as childhood and adult obesity, diabetes, heart disease etc. This poses additional technical and scientific challenges to incorporate these features into our products and in developing new products and ranges." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730029> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The aim of this project is to research a mechanism which can scan the inside of silo using cutting edge technologies and communicate with a wireless node, again utilising the latest advances in communications technology. The end deliverable target is a patent for such a system, device and documentation that should allow for a further development project to commercialise the device and make ready for market. The Farmer or Consumer would be able to carry less stock and avoid oversupply and under supply situations. Suppliers can organize and automate the distribution rounds to outlying farmers efficiently, as well as adjust and maintain predictions of future needs in real time. We anticipate the system will reduce overall stock levels by between 15-20%. This will reduce the cash requirements of a farmer. It would also reduce emissions and unnecessary deliveries. Current scanning systems for silos DO NOT provide a real time linkage from the farm silo to the possible suppliers. We aim to research how to ~·monitoring feed levels within the supply and demand chain of the feed stock. Our proposal takes some of the key concepts used in real time production and applies them to a wide distribution network of materials from a single supplier. Our unique approach to stock levels and distribution brings together a number of leading technologies which we want to develop further and implement in a farming scenario. We believe that such a system would bring efficiency savings." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730030> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "BTDC has successfully carried out a feasibility study into the development of a new Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT) for light weight farm machinety carrying out higher speed transportation tasks. These tasks include all farm work which could be carried out at higher speeds than conventional tractors. Such tasks cover transportation of farm goods and services on and off road, and in-field operations such as secondary cultivation, application of fertilisers, insecticides and herbicides, and harvesting. The breakdown of actual farm tractor usage shows that heavy cultivation, favouring heavy slow conventional tractors, accounts for a minority of tractor use (see Appendix 1), and that the majority of tasks would benefit from the features of higher speed and lower weight. Over the last decade there has been rising awareness of population growth, food security, and increasing scarcity (and cost) of other natural resources, highlighted by recent global crises, giving an extra emphasis to the belief that farming methods have to be reviewed and improved (see Appendix 2). BTDC proposed the development of a new high speed IVT for farm vehicles to promote improved efficiency by reducing weight, and providing entirely flexible transmission gearing. This combination addresses both damaging soil compaction (see Appendix 3), optimal control of a high range of working speeds, and improved fuel efficiency and productivity for farm machinery targeted at agricultural transport." .

Put simply, when applied to a surface, the solution will not only kill bacteria but will continue to protect against bacteria hours after its application. Byotrol wish to develop a second generation solution that can be modified the meet the challenging environments such a hospitals, the home and mobile treatments while still retaining the residual and anti-microbial properties. In order to achieve this research will be done into the modifiable properties of the current solution and different biocide-polymer combinations experimented with in order to enhance the solutions properties. Solutions for the healthcare and military environments will then be developed and a pre-production prototype of a wound dressing incorporating the developed solution produced. The project is expected to cost £1.5 million pounds, which represents a considerable amount of money and risk for an SME such as Byotrol. NWDA supported is needed if therefore requested in order to enable the project to take place. Doing so would ensure the highly innovative commercial project takes place in the North West and the safeguarding of 3 highly skilled R&D at Daresbury. It would also allow the North West to take the lead in the next generation anti-microbial technology that will directly benefit the NHS and MOD." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730032> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This project focuses on the development of new processes to manufacture light weight, super strong material precursors based around a carbon-fibre backbone structure and a carbon ceramic matrix. These materials have many applications, including aircraft and automotive braking, rocket motors, jet turbines and as lightweight protective armour. Carbon ceramics are a relatively new product and costs are high, typically £750-£1000 for a 2kg brake disc. This project will advance new ideas and technologies to significantly enhance the range and properties of available carbon-ceramics and reduce the manufacturing cost of these products, in order to widen their use across a range of industries. We propose the direct use of carbon fibre as a startinj.material, soutced from either recycled carbon fibre, which is now becoming available, or virgin material manufactured from a relatively low cost source. This material will then be processed and assembled into the desired shapes and forms, using novel technology which, if successful, will be patented (preliminary patent already filed). This process is conceptually extremely cost effective (less than half the cost of current technologies) and environmentally friendly with very low material waste levels and negligible C02 or toxic emissions. Additional benefits will be to introduce the use of recycled carbon fibre, and improve on product quality and time to manufacture (currently several months)." .

A range of animation technologies are used in video games, such as Grand Theft Auto and films, including Lord of the Rings and Avatar. These can increase efficiency, but the process generally involves many separate stages with manual intervention required. The proposed research project is intended to produce new technology, which can capture facial movements from video and transfer them to a 3D character in real time. This would drastically improve the workflow and efficiency of facial animation and make new products possible, such as live on-set pre-visualisation and desktop animation tools. Key areas of technological advancement include tracking ofunseen footage without human interaction, tracking facial features accurately in real time and automatic transfer of facial movements onto 3D character controls. As experts in the fields of Computer Vision and Facial Animation, with experience in successfully creating and taking performance-driven facial animation technology to market, we feel we are ideally placed to create the next generation of facial animation technology." .

The main technical objectives of the programme are to integrate fibre coupled UV and NIR arrays optically and electronically into a print system, develop interface and control electronics and basic software, and build a technology demonstrator capable of multi-colour printing. Specifically therefore, the MILED print array will be engineered to emit light at multiple wavelengths particularly in the ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) regions of the spectrum. The output from these arrays will be imaged onto a substrate such that they form a continuous line of dots. A micro-processor will be used to control the sequencing of the different wavelength emitters and permit multi-colour images to be printed. The deliverables for his project is a MILED printer demonstrator capable of printing multi-colour images when used in conjunction with Datalase's proprietary colour change materials technology." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730037> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Gencoa have made a very strong patent application disclosing new methods to improve the way that the plasma is magnetically confined and the interaction with anodes (see Appendix B). It is expected that the significant product and processes benefits of this innovation will open a new market for Gencoa. It is also hoped that a 'side' benefit of these new concepts will be reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint of these power 'hungry' production processes. Gencoa have conducted extensive background research into the area and carried out an informal survey of potential customers. The technique of two targets working as a pair with AC power between the two for the deposition of dielectric coatings is an existing aspect of the technology and has prior valid IPR. The patent application has been based on the feedback from the market combined with the current problems and limitations with the existing technology. The new methods employ asymmetric magnetic field designs and the use of magnetic guidance of electrons into a receiving anode. The phenomenon of the asymmetric magnetic fields when used with rotating targets to generate plasma for vacuum plasma processing and coating deposition is novel and is the basis of the IPR. Simulations work completed indicates a good chance of success, but the lack of any scientific and technical validation obviously impedes its commercialisation. The aim of this feasibility study is therefore to thoroughly characterise and refine Gencoa's new magnetic and anode design concepts. Significant outcomes of this project will allow Gencoa to achieve important goals such as confirm the viability of the new technology, gain the necessary scientific and technical knowledge for the development of new commercial rotatable magnetrons and define their operational, technical and design requirements. At the end of the project Gencoa will have a sound knowledge base for the development of commercial products and have background information to help progress the prosecution of any further patent applications. It is hoped that a subsequent 'development' project will follow the feasibility study." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730041> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This project aims to build upon the work carried out over the last 18months at Crystal Scientific. We already have a pre-production prototype 1.2m flat X-ray mirror enhanced by differential coating. The fabrication of this mirror has involved using the latest metrology equipment at the Diamond Light Source, Oxford, and the collaboration of metrology scientists at this institution. This new method for enhancing the performance of x-ray mirrors has huge promise and the data from our 1.2m flat mirror is to be presented at a scientific meeting and published in its corresponding journal. The aim of this development project is to prove the consistency and reliability of the differential coating technique and to fully incorporate this technique into our production process. We aim to manufacture a series of flat x-ray mirrors of different sizes ranging from 400mm to 1.5m in length. We will apply differential coatings to these mirrors to test the reliability and reproducibility of this technique. This work will culminate in the production of a number of demonstration prototype mirrors to be sent to metrology laboratories world-wide for evaluation. We also aim to extend the differential coating technique to the manufacture of elliptical mirrors. The significant innovation and technical advance of this project will be to develop state of the art mirrors with minimal residual slope errors which can compete directly with the established (bi-morph) mirror technology and be of direct benefit to the scientific community." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730042> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Semiconductor technology continues along the path of ever reducing feature sizes and complexity, which in turn places ever greater demands on process cleanliness and gas purity. There is a need for better filtration and purification technologies and products to meet these challenges and improve process yields. It is particularly difficult, for example, to detect and remove traces of methane below the 1 ppm trace levels. Current air purification specialists, including SAES Pure Gas Inc. California USA. and Donaldson Filtration Solutions Inc. Minnesota USA acknowledge this as a growing problem and are actively seeking technical solutions to improve this from 500ppb to a target of less than 1 ppb. A new solution is needed. What is new about Plasma Air Purification is that the plasma converts contaminants which are difficult to remove to high purity levels, into other molecular species such as carbon dioxide and water; alternatively, these are converted into molecular species which can subsequently be filtered by existing filtration processes such as activated carbon. The fate of the contaminant depends on the nature of the contaminant itself, whether organic or inorganic, and the bulk gas which is carrying the contaminant, whether it contains oxygen or not. Plasma becomes an enabling technology for existing OEM product manufacturers to enhance their product performance. Also new is the way the plasma is generated. The patent owned by Plasma Clean (Attached Annex 14 US 6,635,153 B1) covers a method of generating the plasma in glass beads and a flow path which ensures far more complete exposure to the flow of gas being treated. This has been shown, through the research project completed in October 2008, to enable treatment to new levels of purity in a commercially viable process." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730044> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Please see attached document \"New RCI Product Opportunity\" for a full explanantion As the public demands more and more performance and services from the internet and mobile phones (particularly video )the data rates through the backplanes used in these systems has to increase. The current RoBAT S1 machine can confirm that backplanes which have data speeds in the low Gbps (Gigabits per second, 1 Gigabit= 10 to the power of9 bits)will work correctly when installed in a system. Much of telecommunications has recently moved up to 10 Gbps, there are plans to go to 40Gbps at the end of 2010 and some companies like Cisco Systems are already talking about 100+ Gbps. Companies like Agilent and T~ktronix already make MANUAL equiment (costing around GBP80K) for testing the transmission of these sorts of signals but nobody makes any AUTOMATIC equipment suitable for production volumes. Our own existing customers are telling us thi~ will become a necessity by the end of 2010. We plan to incorporate the Tektronix manual equipment into our existing machine chassis to produce an automatic machine. The difficulty which will have to be overcome is how to interconnect the Tektronix equipment with \"RoBAT interface modules\" stored in our machine and then subsequently with the backplane being tested without destroying the signal quality." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730045> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The technology patented by SpheriTech and described in this application is not only novel but provides an inexpensive and efficient means for manufacture of polymeric microspheres. Page 3 of44 The most important objective is to identify a range of polymers and linkage technologies for the three target markets. Identification of specific protocols and technical know how is essential for the success of this work. Ultimately this will lead to large scale production of specialist polymeric microspheres for each chosen market sector. In biocatalysis the worldwide market for the competing technology is measured in the region of $25 billion (Biocombinatorial Approaches for Drug Finding, Springer Berlin Heidelberg. ISBN 978-3-540-22092-3). $50 billion of the $800 billion global commodity, specialty, and fine chemicals markets are readily addressable by bioprocesses. Another $200 billion has been identified as potentially addressable by biological app~oaches in the next 1 0 to 20 years (Chemical & Engineering News, Volume 79, Number 21). Peptide based drugs are already a major section of the pharmaceutical portfolio. Sales of the top ten peptide based drugs total over $2000m annually and the top five of these are in the late stages of patent protection. The highest value market sector in peptides is in the area of prostate cancer therapy and since these were developed almost concurrently by major pharmaceutical companies they are all nearing the end of their patent life. Leuprolide (Bayer AG, Sanofi-Aventis and others) came off patent in 2005 and already there are 5-6 generic drug manufacturers showing interest. Dr Don Wellings, the founder and CEO of SpheriTech has consulted on the synthesis of Leuprolide for three individual companies that cannot be named for reasons of confidentiality. Affinity chromatography, used in the purification of biopharmaceuticals is the highest contributor to the cost of manufacture. lmmobilised Protein A (a natural protein capable of binding to various classes of immunoglobulin [lg] molecules, excreted by various bacterial strains) for example is used for the purification of monoclonal antibodies. The market size for Protein A media in 2007 was estimated to be $49 million and the market size in 2013 is estimated to be $70 million based on an average annual growth rate of 6% in antibody production. More detailed market research is covered in Part C of this application. SpheriTech plans to obtain a significant market share within each market sector in 3-4 years." .

There are several aspects to the incontinence market, all of which will need a specifically designed version of the sensor and electronics. 1.2 Deliverables Fully developed sensor initially for the incontinence market where low cost of manufacture, reliability of output, miniaturisation and comfort of wearer have been adequately developed, using the subject of US patent 7232255B2 covering the twin heat flux sensor principle. This US patent is the subject of an exclusive agreement between Sequoia and its inventor and has been purchased by Sequoia Early version of sensor from the inventor - Professor Yuli Lozinski, a Russian scientist based in Israel. Additionally, a newer Israeli patent application (also from the same Professor) covering further developments of the sensor, has been applied for earlier in 2008 and is a constituent part of the option being negotiated by Sequoia. We expect to continue to develop using part of the grant to develop the IP to cover the US and Europe. We have also embarked on 3-4 patents developing the sensor in our own right as Sequoia. (A similar sensor would be more simply developed from this work for the diabetic market)." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730047> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Ammonia given off on exhaled breath can be used as an indicator of Helicobacter Pylori (HPylori) infection. H-Pylori is one of the most common bacterial pathogens in humans and is now recognised as a worldwide problem. It causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and lymphoproliferative disorders and is a major risk factor for gastric cancer1• There are considerable differences in H-pylori prevalence between high and low income countries and, concerning children, the prevalence ranges from less than 10% to more than 80%, respectively2 • In fact, it has been remarked that H-Pylori infection is a better indicator of deprivation than deprivation itself3 • In the UK the prevalence is about 30-40% of the population. There are pockets of higher prevalence associated with depravation2 • At the present time there are number of different tests that are available to test for the presence of H-Pylori infection, although they do not provide instant results and can be invasive. These tests are also expensive to perform and involve sending samples to a laboratory to be tested which is time consuming and expensive. The Bedfont monitor will be used nearside the patient and will provide instant results in a economical monitor with a cheaper cost per test, than other tests currently available, making this testing more accessible and possibly prevent the number of ulcers through earlier detection of H-Pylori. This will in turn reduce the prevalence of ulcers and other gastrointestinal diseases, mentioned above, and cut down on the number of invasive tests that are carried out in the NHS. In 1994 a systematic review of Helicobacter Pylori was undertaken by Professor R A Moore in Oxford. This found that the use of H-Pylori testing as a triage before Endoscopy has been proven to reduce the numbers of endoscopies performed by as much as 25%, and save additional sums of about £10 million per year to the NHS4 •" .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730048> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "At first sight the design on the left looks impossible. The entire seat structure {and 150kg occupants) are attached to, and suspended from, the forward beam secured by an impossibly small foot which locks into the floor track. And this structure has to be able to withstand not only bump compression in a crash or heavy landing, but 16G forces under tension and shear in the event of a crash. The computer analysis not only says it is possible using the proposed materials of construction, but that it can be achieved weighing less than lOkg. But no one will believe it until we can prove the theory in a new bank of concept models as shown. There is no doubt that we could not have achieved this stunning new design without the help of SEEDA and we look to SEEDA again for their continued support to raise the chance of securing an advance order. A • .l Project aims and deliverables Blue Sky will build 4 concept models to the correct material specification to validate the Stress Analysis predictions emanating from the July 2008 Research Project, now completed, both to prove the material selection predicted actually works and for demonstration to prospective clients. • Build 4 concept models for physical evaluation to validate the computer analysis • The final output will be a report on the findings." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730049> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Intelligent Network since its outset has wanted to deliver a working solution for true \"on demand\" application provisioning. IBM first brought this concept to market several years ago; however since then no vendor has managed to truly make this concept a reality. The main reason why this concept has not really delivered is that current vendors have not developed new technology to make the concept work nor have they applied the completeness of vision that is required to make this work correctly. To truly deliver on-demand provisioning a decision engine needs to collect information from many sources prior to making infrastructure changes: 1. System performance 2. Network performance 3. Storage availability 4. Business transaction consumption 5. Business transaction importance 6. Cost of Business transaction 7. Historic trends of usage 8. Outside world events and marketing promotions Companies and vendors have spent many millions of dollars trying to solve this holy grail of provisioning. Businesses have large budgets looking to more accurately plan capacity however in reality capacity planning has not moved on to deliver true \"on demand\". This failure is not because the component technology used today has not progressed it is because capacity planning does not dynamically consider all the business and technical reasoning to make informed capacity decisions. Given that excess capacity (still the norm) costs money and is not considerate of the green issues we face today, while too little capacity results in lower costs but poorer business performance, IN identified that a technology step change is required to automate provision of computing resources. Today's provisioning systems cannot work to the best efficiency because they are founded on a bottom-up approach. lnAngel is designed to address the problem from a top-down approach - addressing the businesses required performance and value of transactions first, then looking at available resources and performance then making on the fly decisions to deliver the most costeffective provisioning. The advent of virtualisation, SOA and Cloud computing coupled with lnAngel can now make true \"on-demand\" provisioning a reality!" .

Work pioneered in the University of Surrey has produced an exciting and innovative technology which will allow scientists to address novel cell biology applications in the key areas of cancer research, drug discovery, in-vitro toxicology and stem cell development. In 2007, Labtech International was selected by SEEDA as one of the first companies in the pilot High Growth Scheme. As a result. the SEEDA hub network linked Labtech with the Department of Biomedical Studies in the University of Surrey. A joint venture, DEPtech, has been formed to commercialise patent protected technology developed at the university (for patent information see Part Section 6). The DEPtech technology is licensed exclusively to DEPtech by the University of Surrey (see Part -...~__, E, Section 7) The University of Surrey will not be involved in the development or running of the company beyond receiving licensing payments. All rights to the technology ~sfer to DE~ once a specified license fee has been paid. A!l development work will be undertaken Labtech and the final products will be sold through Labtech's sales and marketing channels. This proposal will define the scope and detail of Labtech's business plan to develop, commercialise and exploit the DEPtech technology." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730051> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "In most cars, the windscreen wipers are driven by an electric motor which drives the first wiper and the second is connected to it with a mechanical link arrangement. Such systems are simple and inexpensive but unsuitable for demanding applications where reliability or space are critical - such as armoured vehicles, helicopters, aeroplanes, ships, trains, surveillance & infrared cameras for civil or military use. In these applications, a more usual arrangement is to drive each wiper from its own motor. In this way there is maximum space flexibility (no need to route the mechanical linkages). The problem is that each application typically requires a new engineering development to ensure the right locus of travel, fitting arrangement, torque characteristics etc. This is further exacerbated by safety certification since many such drive systems are safety critical, for obvious reasons, e.g. windscreen wipers on a passenger aircraft. Our concept is called 'JSize: It is a new type of screen wiper drive system in which an extremely compact but powerful brushless motor and epicyclic gearbox is linked with a novel sensor and electronics control system. Using this technique, each new application simply requires a new set of software control parameters which can be programmed at installation. No mechanical changes are required between each application. Hence the name.... 1Size ... .fits all. There are significant economies and performance improvement for producers, purchasers and users. The innovation has the potential to gain a share in the existing market as well as opening up new applications that were previously excluded because of cost. Many of the routes to market are already serviced by OTM's existing business in gearboxes and actuators. OTM is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. The commercial potential is large with an eventual sales forecast of >£4M/year." .

The key benefit of this integration is that it will enable, for the first time, local, regional and national fire services to train and evaluate all of their command staff on distributed C41 systems. More importantly, this training can be undertaken using realistic scenarios that combine competency-specific educational objectives with data feeds from operational systems. This allows the trainees to experience using the real system while being subject to controlled training scenarios. A further benefit of this approach is that the assessment of specific competencies can be undertaken for some or all of the participants in the training exercises; furthermore a combination of experienced and novice operators can work together in a training scenario. Any number of distributed users from the relevant emergency agencies can participate and be individually assessed in terms of their personal operational capabilities and as a member of a multi-agency team." .

Swimtag is an innovative webinteractive training aid for private and public clubs. A 222 Sports Director spotted the opportunity for a simple product to be sold in a health and fitness club to assist his regular swimming training. Project aims and project deliverables The overall aim of 222 Sports is to develop the Swlf!tftlig idea into a fully functioning and commercially exploitable product. The grant funding will be used to research and assess the technological options through extensive prototyping, trials and testing to confirm the commercial potential of the idea. 222 Sports will deliver the following as a result of the requested funding: • Functioning wristband, docking station and transmitters design. • Extensive trials and testing results used to down select the functioning components. • Beta website providing training analysis and graphical representation. • Filed patent, trademark and copyrights. The Swimtag system involves a user wearing a wristband during a swimming session at their local health and fitness club or public pool. The wristband collect data from an accelerometer and a number of Swimtag fixed transmitters. When the user has finished swimming, they upload their session data to the Swimtag server using a docking station located in the club reception. The user or their personal trainer can visit the Swimtag website, log onto their account and view the performance data from their latest and historical swimming sessions. The website aims to build an online global community of recreational swimmers sharing training tips and plans, setting goals and objectives, charity sponsorship races, health and wellbeing planning, weight-loss plans and even take part in virtual competitions." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730054> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Bristol-based Mi (pronounced \"My\") In-Car Ltd is developing \"Personal Audio\", a breakthrough technology that allows multiple people in the same physical area (e.g. in the same car) each to listen to their own choice of audio content, without disturbing others, and without the use of headphones. Aimed initially at the fast-growing market for in-car technology - currently standing at $11.7 billion per annum - Mi expects rapid market uptake for its planned range of Personal Audio enabled products. The market has already shown an eagerness to develop in this direction, for example with a \"Dual-Zone\" feature being offered by all the major players- Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Pioneer, etc. Dual-Zone simply plays different audio content to the front and back passengers of the car, via separate speakers in the front and back, but the results are - unsurprisingly - just an unpleasant and cacophonous mix of the two audio sources being played. Consumers are not impressed. Mi has started to develop an answer, exploiting its novel and highlyadvanced anti-noise techniques to ensure that each passenger hears only their own audio content, and that content intended for other passengers is cancelled-out. Now, to take the business further, the company requires an R&D Research Project~f_g9~J444 to support an 18 month research project, Q with the aim of delivering a fully-functi~prototype sys~!J:):lhat proves the technologies involved, filing 'IS the fundamental patent applications, and allowmg 1VII to bring to market products exploiting these - innovations. Mi in-car products will initially be sold as aftermarket upgrade systems, to the large established retailers in the sector; and later, as the company grows, directly to car manufacturers. The products will offer a rich set of multimedia features, competitive with the market leaders. All of the conventional audio sources will be supported - radio (analogue and digital), CD, USB/SO card, Bluetooth, Apple iPod, etc. Each passenger in the car will be able to listen either to the main car audio content (selected by the driver), but at their own volume setting; or \"opt-out\" completely and choose their own audio content; or even travel in silence whilst other passengers are enjoying the entertainment. Additional benefits are unlocked when using other types of media. DVD, Btu-Ray, TV, internet and gaming are growing in-car areas, particularly for children travelling in the rear seats, who can watch screens that are embedded in the rear headrests. Mi technology allows these noisy activities to go on without disturbing the front occupants. (Parents will, however, be able to monitor and control all content and volume levels.) The technology eliminates the need to use fiddly headphones, and unlike headphones, it still allows the occupants of the car to talk to each other. In fact, in-car communication between the occupants can actually be  nhanced, particularly between front and rear passengers, because the hardware naturally supports a high-fidelity in-car intercom option. There are other benefits too. For example, hands-free phone-calls can be handled such that only the person in the car who is actually placing/receiving the call can hear the other end of the line, improving call privacy and reducing annoyance to the other passengers. Sat-Nav spoken instructions can be announced just to the driver, so that other car occupants are not disturbed. Additionally, the latest Dual View technology will be offered in the product range, allowing a single screen in the centre-front console of the car to display one image to the driver, and another image to the front passenger. They key word underpinning the Mi products is \"personal\" - personal audio, personal video, personal choice. The Mi solution brings further consumer benefits, too, in the form of improved audio quality, on account of the fact that the Mi solution embeds speakers into the seat headrests. This allows delivery of a balanced stereo image to all occupants, and reduces frequency-response colouration due to acoustic scattering by the cabin interior (this technique is known as \"near-field monitoring\"). Furthermore, the power consumed by the speakers is reduced by a factor of between 10 and 50 times compared to conventionally-located car speakers, due to a commensurate reduction in acoustic path loss, reducing alternator loading, and hence fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Beyond cars, the technology could have other uses too. It is applicable wherever multiple people are seated, and so it can be used in, for example, public transport of any type - road, rail, air, or sea. Premium seats could offer this feature, for instance. The in-car technology market is believed by the industry to be on the brink of an innovative convergence revolution. Last month, for example, Microsoft devoted most of their presence at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (the world's largest electronics event) to promoting their Microsoft Auto operating system, in conjunction with their lead customers Ford, Fiat and Kia. Mi is poised for rapid growth into this exciting multi-billion dollar market. With an ultra-low cost base, a quick-tum and flexible technology platform built from standard components, and experienced management, Mi offers a radical advance that has not been foreseen by the large players. However, to found the business the new company requires grant funding to complete 18 months of initial research, for which total costs are projected to be £156,440 (£148, 140 of internal costs, £8,300 of external costs). A Research Project grant of £93,444 is needed for this activity, supplemented by £62,996 from the founders- see reference [2]." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730055> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "As part of the drive to improve energy efficiency, the aim of this research project is to create a new generation of lightweight high-performance, high-efficiency, planar transformers for the renewable energy, hybrid automotive, aerospace, defence and mass passenger transit industries. Planar transformers are smaller (on average a fifth of the size), lighter (on average a tenth of the weight) and more efficient (approx. 99% versus 92%) than conventional 'wire-wound' transformers. In particular, as well as being electrically more efficient, they also enable any form of transportation to be yet more efficient due to the significant weight advantage they provide. Accordingly planar transformers are especially sought after in electric/hybrid vehicles, mass transit, aerospace and military applications. Himag Solutions is the world's second largest designer and manufacturer of planar transformers, with only two real competitors based in Israel and USA. We use a mixture of copper and PCB technology in our planar transformer products, and manufacture mainly components which are then used in high-frequency power supply applications. Additional applications include: battery charging for electric vehicles, telecom rectifiers, medical equipment, induction heating/charging and welding equipment." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730056> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The proposed project is a software development. Data integration is a significant issue for companies with multiple databases. This often comes about through the merger and acquisition activities of businesses; leading to a situation where the company has multiple databases with duplication of customer records. To gain a view of all of the company's involvements with customers, they have a requirement to merge existing databases into one on a regular basis, in order to provide one single customer view. Traditionally this is performed by batch integration, which is costly and only partially effective as there is significant latency without real or near time processing. The Kynekt IQ project aims to develop a new data integration system with a fundamentally new architecture that provides near real time access to the system, distributed data processing and storage, and the ability to offer the solution as a cloud based service. There will be a range of customer benefits from this, primarily the ability to process in near real time, the ability to access data, the facilitation of a range of unique data integration products ands services to be used with such a system and finally the ability to provide this as a service making it more viable for smaller organisations." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730057> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which is also called 'scar-less' or 'incision-less surgery', is considered by leaders in the field to have the potential to be the next major advance beyond minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. The predicted market value for NOTES is $4bn per annum. In NOTES procedures entry to the abdomen is gained via the stomach (preferred) or colon or vagina. Some 300 cases have now been conducted around the world using standard endoscopes. Surgeons conducting these initial operations have reported that the full benefits ofNOTES can only be realised with new improved tools1. OC Robotics is a world leader in snake-arm® robots. Snake-arm robots are stiff, flexible, steerable endoscopes that are ideal for NOTES. To date, snake-arm robots have been developed for remote nuclear inspection and maintenance, counter-terrorism and aerospace assembly. This work has been widely reviewed and acknowledged. On 21 April2009 OC Robotics was awarded a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the Innovation category. OC Robotics has been monitoring developments in the field ofNOTES and is aware of the new entrants to the field (mostly US venture backed start-ups) and the patent land grab that started in 2005. The task of researching and developing new surgical tools is complex, expensive and time-consuming. Grant support from SWRDA is essential to start this effort and will secure jobs now and in the future will enable job creation in the region." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730062> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "CNC machines use boring tools to produce micron-accurate, geometrically perfect bores in metal components (e.g. motor engine cylinder bores). Compensating for cutting edge wear on these tools is an expensive problem for the manufacturing industry, as it is one of the few functions that CNC machines cannot perform automatically. Interrupting production in order to manually adjust the cutting edges can be very costly, typically resulting in production losses of between five and ten percent (Appendix E10.6). As the first step in overcoming this problem, Rigibore has already developed the technologically advanced 'Active Edge' boring tool system (Appendix E9). Active Edge tools are unique in that they can be remotely triggered to compensate for tool wear by means of a wireless command. To do this automatically, a way must be found for the command to be initiated by the CNC machine control (Appendix E7). Integrating non-standard functionality into CNC machines is technically difficult, due to a complete lack of standardisation between different makes of control. However, after much research, Rigibore has identified a novel method to accomplish this (Appendix E8) and provide the means for any make of CNC control to command any Active Edge tool. The development of this method will result in the product output in phases 1 and 2 of the project. In addition to providing the means to carry out automatic tool compensation, the product developed above will also provide the platform for an extremely flexible process management system. It would enable a customer to easily capture time-coded data generated by the manufacturing process. Uniquely, it would also provide the means to make real-time changes to any of the processes' operating parameters. The monitoring and optimisation possibilities afforded by such a system, coupled with its versatility and ease of use, has the potential to save manufacturing companies many millions of pounds. This product will be the output from phase 3 of the project." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730063> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Designing an electrical actuator that can truly match the power/weight ratio needed . for an 'active' ankle or knee prosthesis presents significant technical challenges and is the driver for this research project. The new actuator must provide a cost-effective, highly compact and more powerful unit able to fit within the volume of the absent limb sections and must offer significantly improved user 'controllability' over devices currently on the market, oelivering performance through a user interface compatible with normal human expectation and therefore be more intuitive and easier to control. Elumotion's target is that actuator components will be electrically controlled with no mechanical engagement. This should permit body generated free-swing of the· prosthetic limb, making use, whenever possible, of 'passive dynamics' so enabling conservation of portable power supplies and preservation of the wearers natural walking gait. Further advantages are anticipated from noise-free operation, robustness to contaminant ingress and the potential for long duty cycles due to high efficiencies and the absence of wearing surfaces. The new actuator is expected to be attractive as a replacement for existing actuators in robotic, industrial, medical, automotive and aerospace applications - offering a significantly more controllable and more reliable component. In particular being able to control the actuator in a shock absorbing mode may be particularly attractive to industrial automation and process control, where manufacturing downtime can occur from assemblies that collide and fail as they do not possess a shock absorbing feature." .

Analysis of deteriation will be processed and analyzed by a computer program together with intelligent analysis methods. The protection & inspection system will be able to inform operators of fleets of gas & diesel engines operating in the Oil & Gas, Marine, Mining, Powergeneration, Transportation/train sector and many other Industrial manufacturing plants/pipelines when their reciprocating machinery is starting to deteriate. The development would produce a unique & innovative uautomated\" analysis system, supported by its own unique software. The intention being to build a flexable a simple, affordable and non-intrusive approach to detecting the mechanical condition of connecting rods and bearings without stripping the engine down for inspection. The software will monitor on-line the meachanical condition of rod rotation and set baseline readings. Any deteriation from the connecting rods and bearing baseline readings will indicate an alert. On any indication of an anomily/change in condition the user will be able to also inspect the cylinders off-line with the 11EnScope\" inspection device. The instrument will also perform a \"leak down\" or flow test. This unique analysis will be performed with the engine cylinder static at Top Dead Centre (TDC) on the compression stroke. Air pressure is added to the cylinder from the En Scope in a controlled manner from manufactured mechanical instrument with the subsequent flow rate measured. These numbers, combined with compression test values from normal service intervals, give early indicators of leakage from either valve or ring sealing issues. The trending of these numbers can better set time lines for unit wear and required replacement of f;lUity parts. Additionaly the system will be able to prduce optional PT & PV diagrams to evaluate performance in engine power cylinders no matter where they are situated in the world." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730067> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The whole issue of energy and the need to reduce its consumption is high on the global political agenda and have elevated the emphasis on the energy management services market. Many companies have shown interest in energy efficiency, and energy management as an immediate option to counter the energy crisis. It has been reported that a building energy management system can typically control 60-80% of a building's energy usage. By optimising the system, for example getting it to perform consistently with the way a building is used, significant saving can be made. Therefore, in order to identify what can be achieved, it is important to understand the current situations within a building. i i This Project relates to the development of increased functionality of the t-mac® technology. Currently available t-mac® systems are web based energy monitoring and management systems for remote monitoring and recording of critical readings and providing real-time and historical reports on equipment conditions. The project is aiming to expand the technology (advanced t-mac®) to enable more sophisticated diagnostics through interfacing with all major building management systems. Within this area of the development, intelligence would be incorporated to recognise and map particular building characteristics against air conditioning and boiler specifications in order to identify optimum settings. T-Mac is also planning to develop monitoring and control system technology that 1 1 meets the requirements for the smaller commercial, ; industrial and domestic users. This part of the project would include the design and development of smart meter optical interface to enable non-intrusive meter reading of existing utility meters (such as gas meters) and submitting readings to the suppliers. The company proposes to employ self-powered (based on energy harvesting such as linear motion, pressure light, vibration etc.) wireless technology interface and intelligent sensors for an optimal low cost solution." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730069> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Advance Pile Drilling System" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730069> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The project was conceptually born out of the company's exploitation programme for the company's large diameter multi-functional drilling system. The major benefit for contractors in using the large diameter multi-functional drilling system was its ease of use in both vertical and horizontal drilling applications. Whilst the company developed its potential use in reverse circulation environments, the company quickly recognised that when reviewing this technology there were major failings when using existing concentric drilling systems and reverse circulation systems where new construction sites adjoined existing buildings. These failings resulted in the de-stabilisation of the geological sub-structure causing major structural damage and, in some instances, buildings that have become unsafe. Through working with senior structural engineers, drilling contractors and building site health and safety inspectors the problems with pneumatic drilling systems used in these environments have been identified with the industry considering the necessary courses of action that overcome such problems. However, with similar occurrences becoming more regular in 2008, both temporary and longer term changes are likely in the future. The existing short term solution has been to employ fluid flushing systems. However, Bulroc is aware of major problems in the use of this type of technology in terms of geological destabilisation. The second type of technology under consideration is a more costly combined air and fluid flushing system which Bulroc has developed around 10 years ago, but the company believe is not the answer. The technical team at Bulroc believe that all the problems with substructure de-stabilisation relate to the use of high volumes of flushing media (either compressed air or water) around the face of the drilling bit during operation which forces this media into the ground, causing both short term and longer term de-stabilisation. The company's proposed project would be the research, design and development of a revolutionary approach to flushing and cuttings removal. The proposal provides an introduction to the development providing aims and deliverables which assists in the measurement of overall progress, a reasoning for why the technology is required, project costs and durations, project location where the research, design and development would be undertaken, and why the grant for research and development would be needed in order for the project to go ahead. The technical aspects of the project (Section B: Technical Work Plan) are covered in the technical work programme which provides information on the research and development tasks to be undertaken and the anticipated technical risks which the company face during the project. The technical methodology is also detailed and provides an indication as to how the company plans to overcome areas of major technical uncertainty during the development project. The project phases break down the major project areas into specific work packages which help the company to identify castings for the project phases. A detailed project cost breakdown is provided, together with an indication as to how the company would fund its contribution to the project. The marketability of the proposed new drilling system is described in Section C. This section of the proposal provides background on the market including its size, geographical limitations, potential customers together with the company's exploitation plan, unique selling points and how Bulroc plans to protect the technology using different forms of intellectual property. The company has already submitted a provisional patent which is included in the Appendices of the project proposal. The final section of the proposal D: Business Development Plan, provides information on the background of the company, its previous support and how the business is moving forward with its existing products, and in what markets. This provides ample evidence that the company has exploited its previous major development projects, and provides full details on the position of the company and its plans to develop International markets in the future. The company is one of the world leaders in the design and development of pneumatic down the hole equipment and has re-established its strong position in terms of new products and technology from its once dominant position in the early 1980's when the equipment was in its infancy. The final section of the proposal also covers the impact the proposal would have on the company in consolidating the company's position within the industry, and positioning Bulroc for further growth in export markets as the civil engineering and construction markets recover into the next decade and beyond." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730070> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The link between exposure to noise and hearing damage is well known and internationally accepted. There is evidence that prolonged exposure to noise levels down to 85 dB (A) can cause damage and the risk rapidly increases above 90 dB (A)1• 29% of EU workers are exposed to dangerous levels of noise during their working day2 and will therefore, be required to wear ear defenders; over-exposure to noise is a major cause of hearing impairment. Engineering SMEs consist of 700,000 companies employing 23.8 million people and with a combined turnover of over €1,500 billion p.a. This sector is under increasing threat from Far East competition, due primarily to their low labour costs and more relaxed regulations relating to noise at work. Consequently, a 20% reduction in the Engineering sector has been witnessed over the last 5 years and the sector continues to be under threat. The construction industry, in addition to the transport and agricultural sectors is also under threat from dangerous levels of noise. These sectors combined represent revenue of over €5,000 billion p.a to the EU and employ close to 50 million people who are potentially exposed to dangerous levels of noise at work. Hearing impaired individuals suffer from social, psychological and physical problems; they are twice as likely to be unemployed and their average earnings are only 50-70% of non-hearing impaired individuals. The Association of British Insurers figures show that deafness accounted for approximately 10% of occupational disease claims. The World Health Organisation describes noise-induced hearing loss as 'the most prevalent, irreversible industrial disease'. The sectors at greatest risk are the manufacturing and construction sectors, followed by the agriculture and transport sectors." .

Using current knowledge, best practice and expertise it can produce rectangular panels of this cloth The project aims to research how to manufacture garments from this of cloth to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to a number of markets - the main issue being that the cloth is slash resistant and therefore extremely difficult to cut and hence shape for the manufacture of garments. Further issues include: how to make the seams of the garment also slash resistant, whilst being breathable, fire retardant, comfortable etc. The commercial objective of the project is to assess the market potential of a range of 10 garments (vests, shorts, gloves, balaclavas etc.) manufactured from this cloth. On completion of the project it is anticipated that Future Textiles Limited will have an evidenced commercial and technical feasibility assessment of the potential method of manufacture of this novel material. It will then be is a position to develop a product based on this knowledge for introduction into the market." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730072> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The project aim is to develop the most advanced wireless based street lighting control system which will automatically dim lights and include the latest smart metering technology. The wireless network will automatically configure, extend as lamps are installed and self heal in the event of a fault. In addition the system will remotely monitor individual lamp power consumption, lamp efficiency and report faults automatically to a central Data Centre. The syst~m will be scalable and control multiple networks with each network typically comprising of 500 street lamps but capable of larger networks up to 2500 lamps The project output will consist of three main components. A small Wireless Lamp Controller for fitting to the top of each street lamp which will replace the light sensor normally found for controlling a street light. The Wireless Controller will have the ability to switch the lamp on and off and also dim the lamp automatically using the latest dimmable ballasts (starters). The Lamp Controller will be designed with low cost smart metering technology and monitor the power consumption of the lamp, quality of power supply and other performance parameters. In addition the Lamp Controller will communicate via other lamps in daisy chain fashion to the wireless Gateway. The Wireless Gateway will be of similar enclosure design to the Lamp Controller but will be fitted with a GPS/GPRS module and light sensor. The Gateway will act as the master controller for the complete network of lamps and issue group on/off/dim commands over the network and gather data from the individual lamp controllers. Data will be transferred via the GPRS/GSM module to a hosted server to provide a Central Data Centre with web based real time viewer and query facility." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730073> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The Integrated Processing System (IPS) project aims to develop a portable, disposable modular sample processing system to pre-production level. The system is intended to be deployed in locations where the laboratory facilities required to process biological samples for analysis do not exist, such as at crime scenes, factories and in  environmental monitoring activities. The concept allows rapid diagnosis to be delivered at tQ,@,point of care without the need for highly qualified operators, saving both time and valuable human resources. The project shall deliver a functional pre-production prototype of the IPS along with supporting documentation concerning the design process, the procurement and assembly of the prototype and the testing performed on the prototype. The pre-production prototype shall be designed for mass manufacture and marketing to the intended sector and shall be used to prove the manufacturability of the system, to develop the process modules and as a firmware development platform for the production models. This technology will allow organisations that currently use out-sourced laboratory analysis to streamline the analysis process, and to reduce the risk of human error. The risk of sample contamination shall also be greatly reduced due to the sterile nature of the device, and the risk of the operator being exposed to  otentially hazardous material is reduced as the entire process is contained and automated. The adoption of this technology by forensics teams and environmental monitoring organisations would enable greater confidence to be placed in the integrity of a given sample, as full process traceability is integral to the operation of the device. The small format also allows the device to produce results at the point of care or at the arrest scene, allowing swifter action to be taken. The project is budgeted to cost £406,000 (APPENDIX C) over a period of eighteen months. The project work shall be completed at Magna Parva premises in Leicestershire, with The University of Leicester included as technology partners in this proposal as their experience and expertise will be called upon during the development of the processing and analysis  echanisms. The IP associated with the LMC project (from which the IPS technology is derived) is shared equally between Magna Parva and the University of Leicester. Comac Engineering are experienced subcontract machinists based in the East Midlands. This company shall perform general manufacturing tasks as required by Magna Parva Ltd. Work requiring a high degree of precision shall be handled by CECA (Centre of Excellence in Customised Assembly) at the University of Nottingham. Magna Parva maintains links with this organisation through various projects, and through the steering committee; of which our Commercial Director is a member. CECA shall also be consulted in connection with the manufacturing design of the pre-production prototype. In the absence of a suitable grant, this work would not proceed. The company books reflect a stable business with sufficient cash reserves to pay outright for the project, however this is a by product of being a high-risk project orientated company that requires a large cash buffer to absorb peaks and troughs in the project cycles and cannot be used extensively for product development. Additional funding was sought through traditional lending; this however in the current climate is not possible." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730074> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Lightweight Motorised Multiple personnel carriage" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730074> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The project involves the research, design, development and testing to a prototype stage a lightweight motorised personnel carriage to transport maintenance engineers, tools and spacers and other componen spares which travel on electricity conductor wire bundles in elevated environments upto 800' between pylons. Since the early 1970's the National Grid has erected in the region of 80,000 pylons or towers to carry conductor wires to distribute electricity throughout the UK. This is an ongoing project resulting in continual maintenance and erection of new towers. After erecting the towers and winching up the conductor wires, multiple configurations of conductor wires have to be kept safely separated by means of a safety critical device, a spacer, which is designed to prevent the conductor wire bundles from contacting each other. Spacers have to be positioned equally across the span, the span being the distance between the two pylons. To fit the spacers, an engineer linesman must first climb the tower to the start of the first span and then hoist the personnel carriage and position it onto the conductor wire bundles so it can travel along the conductor wire bundles. The linesman/engineer must then calculate the sag of the conductor wires to find the correct position for the conductor wire spacer. The proposed project would also include the design and  evelopment of a conductor wire sag level measurement system, which enables precise measurement conductor sag wire. Also, when lengths of conductor wire bundles have to be replaced during restringing where lengths of new conductor wire is connected to the ends of existing wire, safety measures have to be put in place when the conductor wire crosses over roads, railways, other power circuits, buildings and adjacent lower lying infrastructure when conventional protection systems such as scaffolding and nets are not viable or considered too expensive. The industry employs conductor wire catcher safety systems incorporating electrically insulated ropes which run through trolleys which suspend the conductor wire as it is pulled through the span between the towers. Currently this has to be carried out using spacer chairs, but as the use of spacer chairs on single conductor wires is considered too high a risk, the industry is looking for an effective unmanned system to deploy the elevated conductor wire catcher safety system. The trolleys and insulated ropes could number upto 50 across long spans. The remotely controlled tug system would need to operate on single, double, triple and quad wire configurations and would be a critical aspect of the company's proposed innovative elevated maintenance equipment set. The proposal document includes an introductory section, which provides detailed project aims and deliverables, reasons for the research and development, project location, cost and length of the programme of work. This section also provides reasoning as to why the grant for research and development is required to research, design and develop the lightweight motorised personnel spacer carriage, sag measurement system and remote controlled conductor wire  atcher equipment deployment tug. The technical workplan details the tasks required for the development of the lightweight motorised personnel spacer carriage, remote controlled conductor wire catcher deployment tug and the conductor wire bundle sag measurement system used in the maintenance of elevated conductor wires. The technical workplan also clearly identifies the major technical difficulties and how the company plans to overcome such technical risks. This workplan includes the technical methodology and how the project would be completed. The company has outlined the development activities in project phases which are illustrated in a gantt chart to illustrate timescales. The project costs, means of funding and project team are also included in Section B of the project proposal document. The project proposal provides a background to the market with data provided from sources outside the company. The management at Metmachex have discussed the requirements with major potential customers including National Grid, Balfour Beatty, Amec, Babcock Networks in the UK. This has enabled the company to develop an outline specification, which has led to the development of some proof of principle product modules being researched. The company has also provided details of the key features, which would become unique selling points, and has produced a strategy for the exploitation of the technology across the power networks market. The final section of the proposal covers the background of the company, its development plans, past public sector support and financial impact of the project on the company once the development is completed." .

Currently whilst knitted bandages are produced around the globe, none are manufactured in the UK. However, no knitted elastic cohesive bandage is currently manufactured anywhere across the globe. With the proposed development of the first knitted elastic cohesive bandage which, combined with advanced yarn design and structure, advanced elastomer and coated polymer composite spun thread, natural and synthetic latex and other water based adhesives and environmentally advanced fully automated manufacturing methods the company's novel product would provide high added value within the knitted bandage market where they are seen as UK leaders for the veterinary sector. The rnaFk-et for the proposed new product is as a support and retention bandaged used in the UK, USA and Europe in veterinary and human healthcare. This is a vast market and one in which Millpledge is very well positioned, and would be complimentary to the company's current range of products. The deliverables for the proposed project would be: • loose knitted elastic cohesive bandage with novel yarn design and knitted structure, new composite thread technology and new adhesive compound • denser knitted elastic cohesive bandage with novel yarn design and knitted structure with composite thread technology and new adhesive • fully automated process for producing double sided coating, double sided curing, tensioning and winding of the bandage • ageing and mechanical testing reports • provisional patent covering the prototype product technology and the process • technical manual covering the product and manufacturing protocols" .

Data loss, either malicious or accidental, happens on a daily basis without ever being reported. The aim of this research project is to help protect sensitive information and to create or re-establish confidence and control for any organisation that handles sensitive information. The project will conduct state of the art research in document tracking techniques to determine if a novel solution to the data loss prevention problem currently plaguing government and industry can be found. The output of the research will be a demonstration that can be used to prove the concept in a small organisation. Nexor will then look to demonstrate the findings to a number of its base customers, which include UK Government, UK MOD and NATO, while also using a number of technology partners to demonstrate the concepts within their research facilities. Once buy-in from the customer base has been secured, Nexor will look to take the research forward to productisation." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730077> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The aim of this development project is to create a colour detection system that will reliably make calibrated colour measurements of a wide range of fabrics and produce corresponding colour maps to these measurements. The colour inspection technology will work on all roll-to-roll inspection platform, thereby adding a further inspection capability without the need for an additional process. As the material passes under the colour inspection zone it will be measured in real time at speeds up to 100m/minute and the results collected in the data capture model and then integrated to the customers' business system. This will enable users of fabrics to better match adjacent sections and reduce waste in the form of rejects. The resulting technology will be applicable to our existing fabric inspection machines or those of competitors. Accurate colour detection will not only be available for apparel industries but for a wide range of other manufactures using textiles. The key technical objectives for this project are: • lens development to lift the sensor further from the fabrics (40-50 mm) for inspecting larger area. Necessary for high pile or patterned fabrics • Development of homogeneous luminosity to prevent inaccuracies from external conditions. This will enable true colour calibration of our current technology. We intend to achieve a spatial distribution of light intensity of less than 1%. • Air protected inspection zone to eliminate dust/fibre ingress, improving accuracy and longevity of the sensor system • New sensor integration to improve accuracy from Ll£=±2 to Ll£=±0.1 • Software development to incorporate pattern matching capability • Software development to enable integration with customers' business systems" .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730078> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Intravenous cannulation- (i.e. inserting a tube) is the most widely performed invasive medical procedure. Intravenous cannulation is needed for giving medication, fluids and bloods to patients across the globe. In England, the NHS purchased approximately 24 million cannulae and the global figure is estimated to be 30 times this. The cannula once inserted is fixed to the skin by a dressing. The global market for cannula dressing is 70 million dollars. The insertion failure rate in cannulation depends on the patient population, but in medical literature in certain studies, first time failure rate is of the order of 25%. This can be much higher in certain patients such as chemotherapy patients or neonates. Hence difficulty in cannulation is a common and ubiquitous medical problem. The product being developed directly addresses this unmet need. We are developing a surgical cannulation dressing with an integrated and detachable vein inflation system ('Vacuderm') in order to make vein cannulation easier and improve the success rate. This development project aims to address the manufacturing issues, clinical trials, continuing international Intellectual Property registration, CE marking and the preparation for market entry including website set up and some early development of training and promotional material for the Vacuderm. The output will be the product Vacuderm, a mass manufactured, CE marked, Clinically tested, IP rights continuing to be registered, Branded, Trade mark protected product ready for market entry initially in the UK and then in the international market." .

This cuts down the need for users to~ compare and consolidate their individual files a both users can edit a single document at the same time. To enable complex designs, drawings and layouts to be created within a web browser we will be pushing the boundaries of Javascript and embedding the powerful c:four layout engine to ()provide the end user with complex layout algorithms and rendering in a timely manner. RaiiStaff is in the unique position of having a state of the art codebase (the c:four engine) at a time when internet technologies are developing up to a level at which a DTP WebApp is possible.

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730080> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Thls project aims to develop an innovative cost-effective maintenance solution for offshore wind tutfiine btades in situ. The project has three key paratletand combined objectiveJ: 1. Development of a methodology for the fast, safe, accurate and reliable inspection of offshore wind turbine blades (in situ) through the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle comprising a model helicopter and camera equipment 2. Development of a novel access system to enable the safe and effective repair in situ of offshore wind turbine blades- no need for removal 3. Development of a novel, fast, reliable process for the in situ repair of damaged wind turbine blades The tasks outlined in section 17 detail how these objectives will be achieved. The main driver for this project is the need for a reliable long term supply of energy from offshore wind turbines. High availability is crucial for the economics of any wind farm. Given the need for frequent manual interventions, access systems and maintenance processes are highly important to maintain availability. It is acknowledged that as turbine and wind farm sizes increase and as Round 3 projects are built further offshore, access will become even more critical to project viability. The innovation of this access and repair system for the in situ inspection and repair of offshore wind turbine blades lies in: , -Tile use, development and integration of UAV technology, the associated cameras and the I software imaging package to enable remote inspection of the wind turbine blade - increasing safety whilst maintaining the accuracy of repair diagnosis -The development of a UAV based inspection solution that: can be utilised in close proximity to offshore wind turbine blades whilst maintaining accuracy of inspection, can be controlled accurately and consistently in adverse weather conditions out at sea, and can be safely and repeatedly launched and landed onto a suitable platform mounted on an access vessel at sea - The development of a fast, reliable, flexible repair system for the in situ repair of carbon composite turbine blades - utilising dry curing techniques rather than the current preferred 'wet lay up' methodology -The development of a light yet robust, safe, flexible, access system to enable blade repairs to be undertaken in situ. The deliverables from this project will enable a step change in the method and technologies 1 associated with the inspection and repair of offshore wind turbine blades. RTS has considerable experience in the access, inspection and maintenance field and has undertaken ad-hoc trials of the three key elements of this project which will provide a sound basis 1 for this further required development work." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730081> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Gastrointestinal resections are common general surgical procedures (6 million per year global). Surgery involves cutting out the tumour containing area, with subsequent stitching or stapling of the resected ends to reform the tube, this being defined as an anastomosis. Leakage at the site is a major complication of these operations, with catastrophic patient consequences includi9ng risk of death, coupled with costs of re-operation and intensive care stretching into tens of thousands of pounds. The reported rates of breakdown vary from 1% to 30% dependent on locality and other factors. Good surgical technique alone is also not a predictor of outcome anastomoses failing for a variety of reasons and there being few preventative measures. Surgeons tell us that if they could have a \"belt and braces\" adjunct to their surgery, \"anything that would help them sleep at night\" would be welcome. In fact some do use fibrin glues despite a lack of clinical evidence of their efficacy. Tissuemed's tissue sealant technology has been proven in other parts of the study and there are reasoned arguments that it can be modified to provide a support for the healing gut during the critical healing phase. This involves fine-tuning the chemistry to match the characteristics of the tissue, with the associated testing and regulatory work associated with medical device product development. This would be a breakthrough in reducing patient problems, the need for re-operations and associated dramatic costs." .

In 2002 Almec introduced a baseline seat control system aimed at this market. The more stringent requirements for the latest generations of airliners, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 require the development of new system designs. The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost 300W power supply, suitable for use in the latest aircraft types, based on work that we have done for an existing 70W prototype unit. B: The project plan calls for the following key activities, all of which will take place in the UK: · To conduct detailed testing of out recently developed 70W power supply (PSU) prototype in accredited test facilities. This will help to reduce risk by proving the viability of the intended technology. · The design of an initial 300W unit incorporating the lessons learned from the 70W unit, including testing and analysis to ensure that it meets requirements. · The manufacture and validation testing of production intent first articles against industry and regulatory requirements." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730094> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Cambridge CMOS Sensors (CCS) has identified a clear gap in the market of NDIRs and aims to address the issues described above by using a lower cost, higher reliability proprietary technology. Thus, CCS has invented and developed a technology that could replace the bulky, expensive and power-hungry IR sources with significantly lower power miniature micro-hotplates (MHPs) that have the ability of reaching extreme temperatures (in excess of 700°C). The MHPs are made using the standard microelectronics technology, the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) with a single Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) step to form thin dielectric membranes with embedded micro-heaters. The entire process is done at a high volume commercial silicon foundry allowing very low cost and high volume manufacturing. The CMOS MHP technology from CCS is unique and protected by 3 international patents. One more patent application has been filed and one further application is currently with our patent attorneys. CMOS Circuits _s..~r---Oxide membrane Backside ORIE/ Silicon MHP@ sooc Cross-sectional view ot·patented MHP technology Figure 2: MEMS Low Power IR Source The exceptional high temperature and low cost capability of our MHPs makes this technology very attractive for NDIR gas sensing applications. Figure 2, shows schematically the structure and scale of our MHPs together with a photo showing the CCS MHP emitting in IR and visible domain at 800 oc. The diameter of the MHP heater is only 200 microns. CCS has performed reliability and stability tests on the MHPs and have proved that they operate reliably at 600 oc (for over 2 Million pulses with 2000h in an accelerated test). Unlike, the conventional IR bulbs with tungsten wires as IR filaments, our heaters feature thin film, CMOS based Tungstenrritanium layers embedded in a thin silicon dioxide to prevent the metal oxidation and avoid possible explosion, (a common safety issue with current NDIR operating at very high temperatures)." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730095> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The aim of the next wave of products is to increase the flexibility of the modelling tools while rationalising the underlying modelling constructs to increase the functionality of the models and making it easier to extend and personalise the product set. The requirements for the ‘next generation’ and the objectives of the proposed AUDEN project are to: • Enable many vertical sectors to be supported using a common technology base with an extensive personalisation capability i.e. to make it easy to tailor to the specific modelling/visualisation needs of each sector as well as supporting different cultural needs (including user interface layout); • Manage large tiered models consisting of many linked models. In many cases a common model is required to underpin many derived models of different business processes in the organisation to be modelled. Changes in the underlying common model must result in the corresponding changes in the derived models; • Increase the modelling capabilities by enabling a broader range of established methodologies to be combined by a user. Organisations can then consistently use a variety of methodologies as appropriate to their modelling needs. The key benefits of this approach will: • In comparison with the normal modelling effort, this new approach will reduce the time to create a model from 24 to 4 weeks; • Provide a modeller with a ‘pick-n-mix’ approach to modelling. All of the proposed changes increase the capabilities for a modeller to use this approach. From the modelling perspective, the underlying metameta- metamodel is essential so that a consistent model is produced that will create meaningful and useful results. Without such a meta-meta-metamodel the results will at best be inconsistent or at worst meaningless; • Expand the scope of modelling that can be carried out, and the quality and integration of modelling results. The creation of rule based diagram construction and repository navigation extends and complements the innovative approach to the meta-meta-metamodel. Large linked models will allow a wide range of modelling granularity to be produced using a consistent set of underlying common models for the organisation. 4 The key deliverable is a new modelling engine that builds upon the current generic modelling framework but which substantially enhances its flexibility. The underlying meta-meta-metamodel will be substantially enhanced and two new components will be developed, namely: • A stakeholder driven navigation engine and configuration wizard that allows an organisation to define how the modelling tool is to be used by a group of users. An organization will be able to define multiple groups each with their own usage configuration; • A model composition and synchronisation engine that will enable large distributed hierarchical models to be created and managed. This engine will manage all of the common models and the relationships between these and the derived models. The innovations will result in a significant increase in modelling flexibility for the user. Just as important is the use of a generic approach for the rules and behaviours thereby removing the need to change the tool whenever a new set of rule types are to be supported (as is the case with the current tool). The key novelty is the creation of: • The first generic enterprise modelling tool to enable the use and combination of any established modelling methodology; • Unique multi-granular personalisation features that allow enterprise modelling to be usefully undertaken by a wider group of people who do not have to be architecture and/or modelling experts." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730096> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "CML Microcircuits are an established fabless semiconductor company developing high performance mixed signal integrated circuits.  The company would like to start a Project to develop a new circuit that will allow them to target new application areas as a means of growing revenue.  The Project is to specify, design and manufacture a 4-channel data conversion device (Quad codec) offering unique features.  The device will contain 4 main analogue to digital data converters and 4 digital to analogue converters, all built around techniques as the main signal conversion functionality, together with additional lower resolution low power converters for monitoring and control purposes.  It will interface to a digital processor via a fast serial interface bus.  Unique features of the device include a novel digital filter design which greatly simplifies users application of the device, the ability to provide an unprocessed bit stream output from the analogue to digital converters which enables users to tailor their signal processing needs to the incoming signal and a high level of integration not presently available in the market from competing vendors.  The design will provide users with a number of key benefits Reduced system cost as a high level of integration reduces the number of components within a design, also reduced printed circuit board (PCB) area and shorter assembly times, as fewer components need to be placed. Increased design flexibility as a move to a more digitally oriented architecture enables functions to be realised in software and modified via firmware rather than hardware redesign. Improved reliability, as fewer components need to be assembled. Supply chain optimization – reduces the number of ICs and IC vendors in the end equipment. In executing the development the company intends to expand its knowledge of the design of data converters to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  This new knowledge will then be available for further use in CML’s future designs.  It is also anticipated that a number of variants of the basic design can be released as bond out options in alternative packages to target lower functionality requirements such as triple or dual codecs, quad ADC function only, quad DAC function only, etc.  Final deliverables will be samples of the final device, suitable for ramping into volume production, a sample evaluation report and a device datasheet encompassing parameters derived from the evaluation" .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730097> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Development of a Recycling Process for Laminated Packaging" .
<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730097> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The business case for a recycling method depends crucially on prices of raw materials (the waste, including transport, and energy) and the prices that can be obtained for the resulting products. These are global commodities and prices can vary markedly over a short period of time. Despite the experience gained with the previous EEDA project, the applicants do not present an outline business case for the process that might persuade people to buy the machines, preferring to internalise the risk by owning and running the plants at producers' sites. The company believes this segment of the market is worth £30m p.a. and that Enval can intercept £10m of this, but does not state how many plants will be needed nor how much they will cost. So although the economics look favourable, the case has not been fully demonstrated. The competitive situation is complex and dealt with very briefly in the application. There are several approches to the recycling of similar materials namely brick-type drinks cartons, which unlike the laminates to be used in this work contain significant amounts (70%) of paper. Conventional mills extract and recycle the paper content, and most landfill or incinerate the residue of aluminium and plastic (it is not clear if this is a laminate or not). However some make the residue into a structural material, and one in Germany sells some (all?) of it to the cement industry for use as a fuel that leaches aluminium into the cement.  A Tetra-Pak joint venture in Brasil uses plasma treatment of the residue from paper extraction to get back energy, aluminium and paraffin, albeit leaving some material for disposal.  However the Enval process has been shown to be suitable for treating intact plastic-aluminium laminate such as is used for toothpaste tubes, which does not contain significant amounts of paper. Enval has a clear market entry strategy - to start by offering plastic-aluminium laminate producers an on-site service recycling off-cuts or waste laminate at the producer's factory. This has the advantage of cutting transport costs such as might apply to post-consumer waste, and it is argued this scale of plant, whilst appropriate for Enval, is too small to support a plasma treatment operation. In summary, there is an existing market based on recycling used drinks cartons which gives rise to plastic and aluminium residue; the company has an intelligent plan for entering via a specific niche - recycling waste laminate at the factory; the viability of its business model should be better demonstrated with information from this project; whilst overall the market is subject to the vagaries of global commodity prices." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730101> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "The aim of the project is to design, develop and test a novel design of 500c, single cylinder motorcycle engine for the Speedway, Grass track and Ice Speedway markets. This will involve the overall design of a reduced stroke, increased bore engine, one piece crank shaft, use of a balance shaft will be explored, high compression ratio piston head design, use of a programmable ignition system and use of a dry sump configuration. The engine will need to produce in excess of 80BHP and rev to over 11,000 rpm with an appropriate power distribution curve. The overall list of the engine configuration will be discussed in the technical aspects of this proposal. The deliverable of the project will be a fully designed, developed and tested prototype engine ready for productionisation and launch onto the UK speedway scene. This will offer the market a very real alternative to the existing two engine suppliers, it will offer riders a novel higher performance engine with vastly improved reliability and enable them to tune the engine to suit the tracks and ambient conditions to be raced in. These are well established markets that are steadily growing and attract participants from across the world. Currently the engine supply industry is dominated by two key players – Jawa (from Czech Republic) and GM (from Italy). These companies have been producing the same style and concept of engine since the 1940’s. Whilst there have been some reliability improvements over this time, the engines remain essentially of 1940’s technology. Competitors have had no option that to buy from this duopoly which creates stagnation in the industry and diminishes innovation within the sector." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730102> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Over recent years there has been a strong drive by governments to reduce the volume of water used in flushing toilets. Propelair is a radical new approach in that it utilises a large volume of air at a small positive pressure, with just 1.5 litres of water to create the flush. This is not a compressed air system and has the major advantage that it complies with current building regulations and can connect to standard drains (unlike vacuum and compressed air systems). It is directly compatible with existing plumbing systems and simply replaces conventional WCs. A very successful six month trial with two early prototype units at Greenwich Council has saved over 40 tonnes of water and is still ongoing. There are two major elements to this project: the design of each component for function and lowest cost of assembly, and the design of the complex tooling required to achieve this. The latter will be the most technologically challenging. Separately the elements of the proposed development project are: 1. Complete development of the integrated air flush very low water lavatory following on from the recently successful GRaD research project. To conclude with testing to EN997 at theWRc. 2. Design and develop the air pump’s new modulardesign into an assembly of two halves suitable for injection moulding, and especially the design of associated complex injection mould tooling. 3. Design, develop and trial tooling for the cistern container assembly to be compliant with Fluid category 5. Again the mould tooling design will be complex, not least as space is restricted. 4. Develop and trial WC lid components and endurance test them to 200,000 operating cycles. Earlier Polyurethane parts have been found to fracture and fail regularly. 5. Redesign the ceramic WC pans as the current approach has a high failure rate because of drying problems. Also the air and water entry ports need to be designed and incorporated into the ceramic pan, replacing existing high cost plastic parts. 6. Design, fabricate and test a Helmholtz resonator to reduce vibration generated by the air pump. This proposed Development Project follows on from an earlier successful GRaD Research Project supported by the London Development Agency (LDA), also involving STEP and Enterprise Bureau University programmes. Prototype WCs derived from this project have been tested at the Water Research Centre (WRc) and showed performance in excess of EN997, with significant reductions in water and energy use together with high levels of user acceptance." .

The deliverables will be a set of data showing the (lack of) erosion around an offshore wind turbine once the system is in place, and a report analysing and summarising the data. • The work is being undertaken as, without it, there will be no evidence that it works, and as the installation is very capital intensive, it will be difficult or even impossible to win orders without a robust set of data as proof that it works. • The total cost of the project is expected to be £268,436.32 and will last around five months starting early April 2011. This work will be carried out with the support of Eon plc at their wind farm on Scroby Sands near Great Yarmouth." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730106> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "As subsea industries such as oil and gas exploration ventures into deeper water, the operators require faster, more reliable and cost effective technologies. This proposed Development project, a continuation from the Research project funded by EEDA, aims to carry out research, development and extensive underwater field trials to shape the benchtop prototype into a pre-production underwater high speed wireless communication prototype system. The proposed system aims to: i) Reduce uplink acoustic data retrieval time by at least 66%. ii) Lower end-users’ capital investment expenditure by up to 80% through the potential reuse of existing subsea hardware devices for new technology. iii) Low power robust and reliable acoustic communication which uses 500-800 times less energy, thereby extending subsea sensors’ battery operational time. An environmental benefit is the noise reduction to the underwater natural habitat. Sonar Link’s proposed solutions concomitantly lead to carbon footprint reduction. • Sonar Link will design a pre-production underwater high speed acoustic network system prototype, Annex A Fig. 1, which creates an entirely novel set of exploration equipment, with features not available in the market: a. Base-station, Annex A Fig. 2: (a) simultaneous multiple sensors uplink reception offering at least 66% operational cost and time reduction for end-users; (b) High speed acoustic communication up to 138x faster (c) Subsea positioning up to 32x more accurate than competitors. b. Subsea sensors, Annex A Fig. 3: adopting novel low complexity embedded signal processing algorithms where end-users can potentially reuse their existing subsea sensors for new technology. c. Resin-free solid state device transducer: reduces manufacturing and environmental pollution up to 74%.

The object of the project is to prove the efficacy of pulsed ultra violet energy to control skin diseases and pathogens on a commercial crop such as potatoes. Following successful bench-tests, we would like to design and build a test unit on which the efficacy tests could be carried out and, investigate optimum conditions to maximise the effect. B. Initially, we would want to show that pathogens of 4 specific diseases of potatoes can be controlled in laboratory conditions. This would show the necessary uv levels to control the 4 different diseases. Then we would build a small unit that would treat the potatoes as they likely to be in practice, where the potatoes are rotated below the uv lamps to ensure overall coverage. Then we would build a full size test unit to allow bulk quantities of potatoes to be treated and monitored. The laboratory analysis would be carried out by a suitable organisation such as the Potato Council Laboratory. We would undertake all other tasks." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730108> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "This Task will establish the principle requirements and the specification of the automotive debug support IP block. Initially an expert review of the technology requirements will take place to further identify the specific needs the automotive sector has beyond those of mainstream markets. The review will look closely at the key area of engine and powertrain control, which will lead to Carbon reduction and will note the main shortcomings of existing solutions. Important factors will include: the extreme temperature range automotive engine control units must work in and the large cost pressures within the market due to its high volume and significant engineering effort. It is clear that the challenging move towards MPSoCs is becoming very pressing as the complexity of automotive systems is rising faster than the performance of single processor core SoCs. The automotive industry expects to shortly face a step-change where in order to make cars more fuel efficient, they will need to replace their current approximation tables that determine the fuel injection cycle with computational models that run within the engine control unit. This will require at least one additional processor core to execute the model but will offer dramatic fuel and CO2 savings in return. Furthermore, the development of more effective hybrid combustion-electric powertrains is also linked to a substantial rise in complexity that will shortly necessitate an MPSoC. The requirements specification will be based on the input from the project team and its collaboration with leading automotive systems manufacturers and industry veterans in order to ensure relevance for real automotive application scenarios and to closely link in the end users of the technology at an early stage. The end-users we have already engaged see a need for two core capabilities that differ fundamentally from current technologies. Firstly, they need a holistic system-centric debugging capability in order to deliver MP systems; secondly, they see a need for the MP debug to function in their shipped product and aid the system in self-diagnosing failures at run-time – these requirements are key in order to rapidly create low-carbon products using an MPSoC. UltraSoC knows how to realise such capabilities but lacks the financial resources for doing so. Risks include the potential oversight of important requirements that may affect subsequent stages of the development process such as the architecture design and implementation phases." .

<http://tsb.swirrl.com/id/project/730110> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> "Established in 1989, ITP is an independent and privately owned limited liability SME company employing 17 people with an annual turnover of£ 4.3 million per annum. We are an established producer of technical textiles, coated & un-coated special fabrics and films with a reputation for technical innovation and professional service. Application driven products are designed, developed and produced for a number of markets including building & civil engineering, chemical protection clothing and defence. State of the art converting lines that include slitting and rewinding, printing and thermal welding provide much of the added value to roll stock produced to our specifications. An integral element of our business plan is continuous improvement, product innovation and market diversification. Our prime objective is to develop innovative added-value products with higher margin opportunities. One of our specialisations is technical that of protective membranes, principally incorporating flame retardancy, moisture control and chemical protection technologies. By far the most technical and profitable products for the company are the chemical resistance membranes produced for chemical protective clothing fabrics, gas suits and military NBC shelters. Our experience in selling radon and methane gas barrier geosynthetic membranes to environmental consultants has identified the need for a new barrier material. Logically, we utilised our expertise with barrier polymers used in chemical protective clothing materials to develop laboratory-scale proof of concept samples of a suitable barrier membrane. Our investigations identified a specific range of hydrocarbons and toxic chemicals that are commonly investigated in environmental protection project risk assessments and our discussions also highlighted limitations in current industry standards and shortcomings in the availability of test data, specifically data that enables engineers to determine the material's predicted useful life. In the normal course of events, contaminated soil is analysed to determine the concentrations of each contaminant. The difficulty for design engineers is in material selection since little relevant chemical resistance data is available for the contaminants in question. Our project is to produce both a product and an all-encompassing solution for specifiers: 1. a task-specific material engineered to be resistant to the specific hydrocarbons and toxic chemicals (Annex 2H); 2. comprehensive test data for durability and chemical resistance (Annex 21); 3. an on-line software for design engineers whereby the contaminants' concentrations can be uploaded to produce a suitability and predicted useful life report. This development project will provide both a suitable barrier membrane and necessary data to address these needs." .
